Introduction

The first case of COVID-19 was reported in late December 2019 and, on the first days of May 2020, 3 400 000 cases and 240 000 deaths had been reported worldwide [
1
], [
2
], [
3
]. About 80 % of symptomatic patients develop mild disease. In the remaining 20 %, the disease is moderate to severe, and up to one quarter of those will require intensive care unit (ICU) care [
4
]. Severe disease is most frequent in elderly patients with comorbidities but it has also been seen worldwide among younger and healthy individuals [
5
]. The dominating feature of the disease is respiratory compromise, but involvement of other organs, such as cardiac, neurologic and coagulation abnormalities (mostly pro-thrombotic), have also been described, mostly in severe disease [
6
], [
7
], [
8
]. Mortality among ICU patients in most regions is high, especially among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and has been reported as surpassing 50 % [
9
]. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs mostly through contact with contaminated surfaces and inhalation of respiratory droplets. After procedures that involve manipulation of the airway, aerosols can be generated which can participate in transmission of the virus over larger distances [
10
]. Epidemiologic studies estimate that 40 % of all transmission might originate form contact with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients [
11
], [
12
].

Quarantining, social distancing strategies, contact tracing and isolation strategies have been effective in reducing the spread of the disease in several countries [
13
]. Hospitals and private practices worldwide are now contemplating how to resume normal provision of healthcare. It is likely that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to occur after this initial outbreak [
13
] until vaccination or therapy is available, so the return to normal activity also in plastic surgery will happen in coexistence with this disease, and measures should be put into place to minimize risks within these facilities.

With the partial ending of the lockdown, institutions all over Europe are anticipating a return to 'normal' work practice. Although different countries impose different protocols and regulations there are many similarities. However, local situations vary significantly in terms of infection rates, degree of utilization of local capacities of health care system, local resources for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and others. Most hospital administrations impose rules as to the use of consultation- and operation-room facilities on their premises. Government regulation addresses regular healthcare first and foremost. This leaves a lot of uncertainty in plastic surgery for private practices, ambulatory surgery facilities, private clinics and hospitals. On top of this, aesthetic procedures are being considered non-essential and as such are on the bottom of the list of procedures being allowed in hospitals ([
Fig. 1
]). However, public perception and the reputation of the specialty could be significantly affected if for example aesthetic surgery is Commenced to early and with insufficient regard for the safety for patients and staff. Therefore, avoiding complications and being perceived as a serious medical specialty puts extra stress on everything plastic surgeons will decide and perform in the next couple of months.

Current Ranking of possible Plastic Surgery with emergency and urgent surgery being possible all over Europe. Elective Surgery is still banned in many countries and aesthetic surgery in most European countries.

The aim of this paper is to summarize the results of a consensus process and a European webinar of the two societies, European Association of Societies of Aesthetic Surgery (EASAPS) and the European Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Societies (ESPRAS) on what is considered safe practice based on the scientific knowledge we have today. This review of the current situations gives considerations which have to be taken into account when getting back to work in plastic surgery with COVID-19 in Europe. At all times, one should be familiar the local and regional infection rates in the community, with particular emphasis on the emergence of second and third waves of the pandemic. Due to the fast-evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic the recommendations aim to be rather considerations than fixed guidelines and might need to be revised in near future.

Material and Methods

The board of directors of EASAPS and ESPRAS organized a live webinar on May 1
st
, 2020 with chairs from different specialties (plastic surgery, anesthesia, infectiology) to focus on the following four daily life situations:

Consultations and clinical examination

Non-surgical procedures

Surgery under local anesthesia in an ambulatory setting

Surgery under general anesthesia

Furthermore, attending viewers (n = 276) from all over Europe were asked to answer poll questions that were displayed throughout the webinar. 41 % of the respondents have a full-time private practice, 39 % have a part-time private practice and 20 % do not have a private practice.

73 % of the respondents reported no COVID-19 contact that they were aware of, while 1 % was COVID-19 positive, 23 % knew a colleague that was tested positively and 3 % had an infected family member. When asked 'if they had stopped their consultations': 8 % responded: not at all, 5 % stopped their consultation before March 1
st
, 32 % between March 1
st
and March 15
th
, 53 % between March 16
th
and March 31
st
and 2 % between April 1
st
and April 15
th
.

43 % of the respondents perform Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-testing for COVID-19 before all surgeries, while 21 % perform PCR-testing for elective surgeries only and 36 % do not perform any PCR-testing at all. 34 % of the respondents use Computer tomography scans (CT) for COVID-19 screening, while 52 % are not using any CT-diagnostic and 14 % use both, CT and PCR testing.

44 % of the respondents do not know the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of COVID-19 high risk patients, while 56 % do. 29 % have the opinion that even for consultations, a modified consent should be in place, 24 % think it is necessary for surgery only while 22 % think that both non-surgical and surgical interventions COVID-19, infection risk should be included into the consent, and 24 % think that they do not need any consent form adjustments.

Of all respondents the vast majority (90 %) did not perform any minimally invasive procedures including Botulinum toxin or fillers after elective surgery was stopped in their country, while 10 % performed a few interventions. Only 1 % have operated on a COVID-19 positive patient in an elective setting, while 9 % operated on COVID-19 patients in an emergency setting and 90 % did not operate on any COVID-19 positive patient.

Of all respondents, 10 % have, at the time of writing, have recommenced elective surgery, while 64 % will start soon and 26 % are still waiting for a date to be announced. (Figures 2 a-d)

FFP2 masks or higher for doctors and surgical masks or higher for patients

Doctors should wear clothing that should be washed every day at 60deg or that is disposed by the end of the office-day

Eyes should be protected using glasses or face-shields

Pre-screening
If possible 24-48 hours before appointment patients should be asked using a questionnaire via phone regarding the presence of symptoms (fever, headache, fatigue, coughing, sneezing, limb pain, sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, respiratory distress, anosmia) or if they have had contact with a COVID-19 contact within the past 14 days. If the patient has symptoms or reports, contact with a COVID-19 they should be referred to their GP or testing-facility. If no symptoms or contact with COVID-19 patient the planned appointment is confirmed, however organizational and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) changes (see below) should be adhered to.

Organization and Infrastructure
Staff at registration should be protected with protective barrier. If possible, several waiting rooms with a minimum distance of 1.5-2 meters (depending on the National guidelines) between waiting chairs should be established. Patients should be appointed with a 15-minute delay from the finish time of previous appointment. Remind patients of being on time. If patient arrives early or consultation takes longer than planned and waiting room capacities are not sufficient to allow for 1.5-2 meters distance between patients, patients should be asked to wait locally outside the facility, for example in their car. Consider removal of self-service amenities including coffee dispensers and magazines to avoid spread of infection via surfaces. In general, consider the possibility of telemedicine. For plastic surgery in many instances video-based telemedicine might be necessary rather than phone-based telemedicine. Patients that need prescriptions or sick-leave certificates should be provided with aforementioned electronically or by mail. Patients should be advised of the change in patient flow practices at the facility (including for example they need to wear facility provided rather than personal masks)

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Staff and patients should to cover their mouth and nose with a mask at all times. Patients should be asked to bring own masks, however if this is not possible the hospital/practice should be able to provide masks at all times. It is mandatory to check with local authorities if there is still enough PPE in stock at hospitals where COVID-19 patients are treated to avoid any shortages in centers, where PPE are absolutely necessary. If possible, social distancing should be adhered to as long as possible - of course this will not be able during a physical examination, thus physical examination should be performed in a timely manner without sacrificing diligence. Examinations in the head/neck region where inspired air will be shared should be performed using FFP2 masks or higher, to avoid infection via aerosols. Doctors should wear clothing that can be washed daily at 60deg or that is disposed of that the end of the consultation/intervention or at the end of the day. Moreover, eyes should to be protected using glasses or face-shields ([
Table 1
]).

Keep in mind that emergent procedures, should be prioritized over urgent, non-urgent but time sensitive, elective and finally aesthetic interventions.

Prescreening
Previously outlined recommendations regarding prescreening apply. However, patients undergoing a procedure in the face and neck region should present with a negative PCR test or negative chest CT scan. Again, it is questionable if aesthetic minimally invasive treatments justify the allocation of testing resources or radiation exposure of a chest CT scan.

Organization and infrastructure
Abovementioned changes should be adhered to. Furthermore, if doctors should decide to perform minimally-invasive procedures as i. e. soft-tissue filler augmentations or Botox-injections treatment chairs should be disinfected using chlorine-based cleaning solutions after every treatment. Possibility of COVID-19 infection should be included into the consent form.

Again, keep in mind that emergent procedures, should be prioritized over urgent, non-urgent but time sensitive, elective and finally aesthetic interventions.

Pre-screening
Previously outlined recommendations regarding prescreening apply. However, patients undergoing a procedure in the face and neck region should present with a negative PCR test or negative chest CT scan. Again, it is questionable if aesthetic minimally invasive treatments justify the allocation of testing resources or radiation exposure of a chest CT scan.

Organization and Infrastructures
See above for minimum-standard infrastructure upon arrival of the patient. Increased COVID -19 risk should be mentioned in the consent form. Outpatient operation theatre should be separated from operation theatres treating COVID-19 positive patients if applicable. The surgeons and staff treating COVID -19 negative and positive patients should not be the same.

During surgery, there should be a minimum of required staff within the operation theatre.

Noise levels in the operation theatre should be kept to a minimum to reduce loud talking and shouting -known to increase aerosols. Elective surgery can only be performed if the hospital has sufficient resources of PPE and utilized material (local anesthesia, surgical instruments, gauzes etc.). The operating room should have adequate ventilation ensuring the minimal turbulence and promotion of aerosol. Smoke evacuation should be available when electrocautery other smoke generating equipment is used. The operating theater should be cleaned between operations with viricidal cleaning solutions.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Abovementioned changes should be adhered to. For procedures involving the face, surgeons should wear FFP2 masks or higher, to avoid infection via aerosols. If surgery allows, patients that undergo procedure is to the face, should be covered with surgical masks or higher as well ([
Table 3
]).

Protocols should be in place to ensure that there is a safe way to distribute medications, equipment, food and linen to both COVID-19 positive and negative parts of the hospital with no or minimal interaction

Minimum of required staff within the operation theatre

Operating room should have adequate ventilation ensuring the minimal turbulence and promotion of aerosol

Smoke evacuation should be available when electrocautery other smoke generating equipment is used

Operating theater should be cleaned between operations with viricidal cleaning solutions

Discharge management should be activated prior to surgery to allow for fast transfer to rehabilitation facility or home in order to minimize duration of hospital stay

Consider a post-op social isolation period to reduce incidence of a new exposure and infection as feasible, excluding needed post-op visits

Beds in the room should be spaced so that there is 1.5 m between patients

The dressing changes should be done preferably in the patient's room with nurses bringing in only the material needed for a single patient

Prescreening
A negative PCR test or negative chest CT in emergency cases should be obtained. Preoperative tests and preparation for general anesthesia should be done before the testing for COVID-19.

Organization and infrastructure
The patients should be admitted to the hospital if possible, on the morning of surgery with all investigations, anesthetic consultations Etc. carried out on the morning of the surgery where possible. The wards and operating theaters treating COVID-19 negative patients should be separated from wards and operating theaters used to treat COVID-19 positive patients. The surgeons and staff treating COVID-19 negative and positive patients should not be the same. Protocols should be in place to ensure that there is a safe way to distribute medications, equipment, food and linen to both COVID-19 positive and negative parts of the hospital with no or minimal interaction.

Because there is a significant potential for a resurgence of the virus in the second and third waves - plans should be made to have an available capacity in the intensive care units within a short period of time (72 hours). To this end - a gradual increase in elective surgery as appropriate, with the appropriate adjustments based on the reported local and regional infection rates.

Increased COVID-19 risk should be mentioned in the consent form. Formation of a committee consisting of surgeons, anesthesiologists, infectiologists and nurses that decides upon prioritization and escalation of surgical activity. Discharge management should be activated prior to surgery to allow for fast transfer to rehabilitation facility or home in order to minimize duration of hospital stay. Consider a post-op social isolation period to reduce incidence of a new exposure and infection as feasible, excluding needed post-op visits. Hospitals should create an environment for elective surgery, in which evidence-based prevention techniques, access control, workflows and distancing protocols are in place. The beds in the room should be spaced so that there is 1.5 -2m between patients. The dressing changes should be done preferably in the patient's room with nurses bringing in only the material needed for a single patient. If possible, the bathrooms and sanitary facilities should be in the patients' room to minimize the number of users with regular cleaning using viricidal cleaning solutions

The operating room should have adequate ventilation ensuring the minimal turbulence and promotion of aerosol. Aerosol generating procedures should be minimized and smoke evacuation should be available when electrocautery or other smoke generating equipment is used. The operating theatre should be cleaned between operations with viricidal cleaning solutions. The number of personnel required in the theater during surgery should be reduced to a minimum. Standardized handover protocols to optimize workflow should be in place.

As screening methods, both PCR tests and Chest CT are not 100 % specific consider the possibility that every patient is potentially COVID-19 positive. Alterations should be made to the consent form to reflect this. The usual preoperative tests are performed depending on the procedure and length of surgery, as given by general anesthesia. Consider the possibility that COVID-19 positive and recovered patients have a degree of hypercoagulability so appropriate measures should be taken. Consider postponing high-risk patients when risk outweighs the benefit. If ICU care will be needed or is probable after the procedure, consider the availability depending on the epidemiologic situation in your area.

A ""high quality"" filter should to be placed between the breathing circuit and the patient's airway to protect the machine from contamination and allow taking of gases sampled for analysis. Heat and moisture exchange filters (HMEFs) are a good choice since they preserve airway humidity and are designed so that sampled gas is filtered before it enters the gas analyzer (note that HMEs without filters provide no protection to the anesthesia machine or gas analyzer). It is possible to use a filter only at the airway that is not also a heat and moisture exchanger, but strategies like low flow anesthesia should be employed to preserve humidity. If a filter only is used at the airway, lower fresh gas flows (1-2 L/min or less) are desirable during maintenance of anesthesia to preserve humidity in the circuit. Manufacturer's recommendations should be used to sterilize the ventilator when necessary. Intubation is an aerosol generating procedure, so the anesthesiologist and anesthesiology technician have to wear a FFP 2 or higher mask and face shield and disposable nonpermeable gowns. The same rules are necessary for extubating procedure. Use of endotracheal intubation is an option to reduce the aerosol in the operating room (use of supraglottic devices are not recommended in this time). For COVID-19 positive patients' surgeries should only be performed in emergencies considering the general status of the patient. Non emergent procedures are postponed until the patient recovers from Covid-19. Regional/local anesthesia is a better option if is it possible. For Covid-19 negative patients who need urgent or oncological procedures whose postponement would lead to worsening of the condition, operations under general anesthesia can be performed considering the general considerations mentioned above. For patients undergoing elective procedures including Aesthetic surgery, operations under general anesthesia can be performed considering the considerations mentioned above. COVID-19 high risk patients should be postponed ([
Table 5
]). It is recommended that operating times be kept to a minimum and quick postoperative mobilization of the patient should be encouraged.

Table 5
CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) Criteria for high risk patients to suffer from severe COVID-19 disease [
14
]. The conducted poll revealed that 43 % did not know the CDC definition of COVID-19 high risk patients.

65 years or older

Living in a nursing home or long-term care facility

Medical Conditions:

Chronic lung disease or moderate/severe asthma

Serious heart conditions

Immunocompromised

Severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m
2
)

Diabetes

Chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis

Liver disease

Patients that have recovered from COVID-19 infection, can be scheduled for general anesthesia within two to four weeks after full recovery. On consultation, patient has to have at least two negative tests on COVID-19. The best estimation of recovery is a patient's normal response to common physical activities. It is generally agreed that Aesthetic procedures should be postponed for additional 2 months, as the potential for reemergence as not fully known.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Abovementioned changes should be adhered to. For procedures involving the face, doctors should wear FFP2 masks or higher, to avoid infection via aerosols. If surgery allows, patients that undergo surgeries in the face, patients nose, and mouth should be covered with surgical masks or higher as well ([
Table 4
]).

For private-practices

Prescreening
A negative PCR test or negative chest-CT cases is recommended. Preoperative tests and preparation for general anesthesia should be done before the testing for COVID-19.

Organization and infrastructure
Elective surgery can only be performed if the hospital has an environment for elective surgery, in which evidence-based prevention techniques, access control, workflows and distancing protocols are in place, with sufficient resources of PPE for the procedure and care. The surgeons and staff treating patients should not be working with COVID-19 positive patients in public hospitals at the same time. Discharge management should be activated prior to surgery to allow for fast transfer to rehabilitation facility or home in order to minimize duration of hospital stay. Consider a post-op social isolation period to reduce incidence of a new exposure and infection as feasible, excluding needed post-op visits. The beds in the room should be spaced so that there is 1.5 m between patients' single bedrooms are preferable. The dressing changes should be done preferably in the patient's room with nurses bringing in only the material needed for a single patient. If possible, the bathrooms and sanitary facilities should be in the patient's room to minimize the number of users with regular cleaning using viricidal cleaning solutions. The operating room should have adequate ventilation ensuring the minimal turbulence and promotion of aerosol. Smoke evacuation should be available when electrocautery or other smoke generating equipment is used. The operating theater should be cleaned between operations with viricidal cleaning solutions. The number of personnel required in the theater during surgery should be reduced to a minimum. Anesthesia regulations apply as mentioned above.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Abovementioned changes should be adhered to. For procedures involving the face, doctors should to wear FFP2 masks or higher, to avoid infection via aerosols. If surgery allows, patients that undergo surgeries in the face, patients nose, and mouth should be covered with surgical masks or higher as well.

Emergencies in Plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery
Emergencies in Plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery should be defined as trauma of the face with major bleeding, inferior rectus muscle entrapment in orbital fractures, fasciotomies and escharotomies in trauma and replantation and revascularization. Furthermore infections of the hand that need surgical treatment or uncovered structures after extensive traumas should be considered as emergencies in plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery.

Conclusion

Covid-19 has changed our world, now it is up to us to adapt to the new circumstances. These considerations aim to help reestablishing working after the COVID-19 pandemic, enhancing patient safety and work ethics, as in total 90 % of respondents have not, we commenced elective operations so far. Informing patients about the impact of COVID-19 on aesthetic procedures is important in that regard. With these guidelines, it is imperative that we remain up to date with the local protocols and remain aware of the local and regional community infection levels. Updated information will be distributed via EASAPS/ESPRAS websites (
www.espras.com
;
www.easaps.org
).

As an organization EASAPS/ESRAS has worked diligently to formulate these considerations based on evidence-based medicine and in line with most laws and standards. However, regional and national regulations may be different, in parts, and therefore regional and national laws will always take precedence over this text.

This paper demonstrates the need for a strong European partnership amongst plastic surgeons throughout Europe so to focus efforts an information in our field. The cooperation between EPSRAS and EASAPS proved to be most effective.

Background
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-
2), is a highly contagious disease that appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China
in December 2019. It has now spread to multiple countries through infected persons
travelling mainly by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including
fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and
develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis
and coagulopathy including a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
There is little international guidance on how to manage thrombotic risk,
coagulopathy, and DIC in patients with COVID-19 This brief paper provides concise
pragmatic guidance on management of both thrombotic risk and DIC.
This is living guidance document that will be updated weekly.
Managing risk of hospital-associated venous thromboembolism
Hospital-associated venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE) includes VTE occurring in
hospital and for up to 90 days post discharge.
COVID-19 infected patients are likely to be at increased risk of HA-VTE, especially if
they become immobilised on critical care. At the moment it is unclear if hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 have a greater risk of VTE than other medical patients who
have chest infections and elevated D-dimer values (Darzi). Some have used an
elevated D-dimer in a scoring system to identify those at increased risk of VTE
(Spyropoulos).
Critically ill patients fulfil two out of three criteria of Virchows triad which states that
reduced venous flow from immobility, prothrombotic changes and vessel wall
changes increase the risk of VTE. Patients with severe COVID-19 are immobile,
have an acute inflammatory state leading to a hypercoagulable state. There is also
the possibility of endothelial cell activation/damage due to binding of the virus to
ACE2 receptor. The optimal thromboprophylaxis in COVID patients is unknown.
Drug-drug interactions between antiviral treatments and direct oral anticoagulants,
and the difficulty in maintaining stable INRs in patients taking vitamin K antagonists
while unwell, mean that patients on these drugs should be switched/bridged to low
molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) or unfractionated heparins (UFH) with or
without mechanical prophylaxis while unwell.
1
Recommendation1: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) must be
assessed in all patients admitted to hospital, and prevention should be given
to all high-risk patients according to international guidance on
thromboprophylaxis in medical patients(NICE/ASH).
i.e. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis should be given to all immobilised and
severely ill patients with COVID-19 patients unless otherwise contraindicated
For CrCl > 30: Give LMWH or fondaparinux s.c. according to license
For CrCl < 30 or AKI: Unfractionated heparin 5000 units SC BD or TDS or dose-
reduced LMWH
All completely immobilised patients would benefit from intermittent pneumatic
compression in addition to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.
Mechanical thromboprophylaxis should be used alone if platelets <30,000 or
bleeding
Recommendation 2: Consider the possibility of
pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of
oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure.
Recommendation 3: Consider switching to LMWH in patients taking direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonist (e.g warfarin) for stroke
prevention in atrial fibrillation or previous VTE.
Management of COVID-associated coagulopathy
Descriptions of infection with Covid-19 from Wuhan, China described a coagulopathy
in patients who were critically ill with Covid-19. It has long been recognised that
activation of coagulation and/or fibrinolysis occur as part of the acute inflammatory
response. Zhou et al performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study of 191
adults with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from Wuhan Hospitals. Coagulopathy,
defined as a 3 second extension of prothrombin time (PT) or a 5 second extension of
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), was present in 50% of the non-
survivors but only 7% of the survivors (p< 0.0001). Thrombocytopenia was a poor
prognostic factor as in other groups of patients admitted to intensive care (Hunt).
Platelet counts < 1009 /l were noted in 20% non-survivors compared to 1% of
survivors (<0.0001)
Multivariable regression showed increased odds of in-hospital death associated with
very high D-dimer values (odds ratio 18.42, CI -2.6-128; p=0.0033). Higher values of
D-dimers have been reported to be associated with 28-day mortality in patients with
infection or sepsis in the emergency department (Rodelo et al)
2
Tang et al looked at coagulation screens, D-dimer & FDPs and antithrombin levels in
183 consecutive patients in Wuhan with an overall mortality of 11.5%5. Non-survivors
had marked derangements in haemostatic defects at the time of admission in
comparison to survivors with prolongation of APTT, PT, elevated D-dimers and fibrin
degradation products (FDP). Progressive elevation of D-dimer and FDP was seen in
non-survivors. Fibrinogen levels remained elevated in keeping with an acute phase
response initially as opposed to a reduction that is commonly seen in DIC, mainly
after day 7. In this cohort 71% of non-survivors met the International Society of
Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria of DIC compared to 0.4% of survivors. Higher
D-dimer and FDP levels track with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and poorer
prognosis. (Wang et al, JAMA 2020). Median time to onset of DIC was 4 days into
hospital admission but it is unclear at what stage of the illness patients were
admitted.
Histological similarities have been shown to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the cause of a previous endemic between 2002-3, similarly
causing ARDS. Localised pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema,
desquamation with hyaline membrane formation and an interstitial mononuclear
inflammatory infiltrate have been seen. Localised pulmonary arteriolar thrombosis was
seen with SARS but has not yet been described in the case reports of autopsies from
patients with COVID-19 (Xu et al). Pulmonary vasculature thrombosis is likely to be a
result of the severe hypoxia for hypoxia is a profound stimulant of coagulation (Ten et
al). While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in some severe
COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, it seems more logical to reduce the hypoxia if possible,
rather than to submit patients to a therapy with no published efficacy and a high
bleeding risk.
There is no proven benefit in correcting abnormal coagulation with replacement of
missing coagulation factors (Hunt)
Recommendation 4: Abnormal coagulation results do not require correction in
patients who are not bleeding.
Management of bleeding in COVID-19
In minor bleeding monitor FBC and coagulation screen &/or TEG/ROTEM
TEG/ROTEM should only be used if risk assessment shows they do not cause risk of
aerosolisation of blood or they can be used in a Safety hood.
If major bleeding, (an arbitrary definition of major haemorrhage is bleeding which
leads to a systolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg and/or heart rate more than
110 beats per minute.)
3
1) Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be given early in the resuscitation process
at an initial dose of 12 - 15 ml/kg (pragmatically 1 bag for every 20 kg, or 4
units in an adult), after base line coagulation studies taken but before results
available. Further FFP should be guided by laboratory or near patient tests with
a transfusion trigger of PT > 1.5; or if the results are not available with rapid
turnaround, a further 4 units of FFP may be transfused prior to moving on to
'goal-directed' therapy.
2) Platelet transfusion: dose of one adult therapeutic dose (1 apheresis pack or
4 pooled units) for platelet count < 50 x 109/L in complex trauma especially with
head injury. (BCSH guidelines for the use of platelet transfusion, 2003). There
is no evidence for the need to maintain a platelet count higher than 75 x 109/L
3) Fibrinogen replacement. Hypofibrinogenaemia is common in massive
haemorrhage and fibrinogen is the first factor to fall to critical levels; fibrinogen
levels of < 1 g/L are likely after 1 - 1.5 times blood volume replacement (Hiippala
et al, 1998, Hirshberg et al, 2003) and bleeding will be exacerbated by a plasma
fibrinogen of < 1.5g/L. FFP alone is unlikely to be sufficient to improve
fibrinogen levels (4 units raising the fibrinogen by approximately 1 g/L in an
adult). If bleeding continues and fibrinogen levels are <1.5g/L (or equivalent
level suggested by TEG/ROTEM), fibrinogen should be replaced in the form of
cryoprecipitate (two 5 unit pools raising the fibrinogen by approximately 1 g/L
in an adult). Fibrinogen concentrate (if licensed) is used extensively as an
alternative to cryoprecipitate, usually given at a dose of 3 to 4 gms
4) Tranexamic acid (TA). Multiple trials have shown that 1gm of TXA followed by
another gram are efficacious and safe in patients with bleeding. Importantly, for
a drug that affects haemostasis, there were no increased thrombotic events:
and a trend to a lower rate of arterial events in those receiving TA. Adult patients
with major haemorrhage, in whom antifibrinolytics are not contraindicated, and
who do not have DIC should be given tranexamic acid as soon as possible in
a dose of 1g over 10 minutes followed by a further dose of 1gm if bleeding
persists or restarts in the next 24 hours
5) Other agents
a) Recombinant activated factor VIIa (rVIIa) is approved for use specific inherited
bleeding disorders. It has also been used widely 'off label' in patients with
massive transfusion after major surgery or trauma without a pre-existing
coagulopathy. Despite early reports suggesting great benefit, these findings
were not replicated in further studies, and a recent Cochrane meta-analysis on
the off-license use of rFVIIa (Simpson et al) showed only modest reductions in
total blood loss or red cell requirements (equivalent to less than one unit of red
cell transfusion). For other endpoints there were no consistent indications of
benefit and no trial has been powered to study effect on mortality. Levi et al
reviewed safety of the 4468 patients entered into trials of rVIIa and found an
increased rate of arterial thromboembolism: those in over 65 years had a rate
of 9% vs. 3.6%, p=0.003;. rVIIA is not recommended in patients with
COVID-19.
4
b) Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). There is a paucity of data reporting
the utility and safety of PCC in managing bleeding in this setting. This agent
agent may be prothrombotic and is not recommended patients with COVID-
19.
Recommendation 5. For patients with major bleeding give empirical FFP and
red cells followed by blood products determined by repeat coagulation screens,
using PT/INR >1.5 or APTT > 1.5 as an indication to give FFP 15-25mg/Kg. For
fibrinogen <1.5g/l give cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate, if platelets
<50x 109/l give a pool of platelets. If the patient does not have DIC then also
give tranexamic acid 1gm IV.
Management of disseminated intravascular coagulation in COVID-19
DIC is common in many patients in ITU as part of multiorgan failure. It is uncertain
whether COVID-19 has unique characteristics to cause DIC. As DIC is usually only
seen in severely ill patients, this seems unlikely. It seems more plausible that DIC
develops in patients with COVID-19 after they become hypoxic, and/or have
secondary bacterial infection. The diagnosis of DIC is easiest using the ISTH DIC
score calculator. A score < 5 means DIC is not present and the score should be
recalculate every 1-2 days as necessary. The best management of DIC is to identify
and treat underlying condition, which with COVID-19 is difficult. Lastly Recovery from
DIC is dependent on endogenous fibrinolysis breaking down the disseminated
thrombi. This process will be inhibited by tranexamic acid which is an antifibrinolytic
Recommendation 6: Manage bleeding with blood product replacement as per
managing major bleeding as above: i.e. if PT/INR or APTT ratios are greater
than 1.5 then give FFP 15-25mg/Kg; if fibrinogen is <1.5g/l then give a source
of fibrinogen- either cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate; if platelet are <
50x 109/l then give platelets
Recommendation 7: Do not use tranexamic acid in COVID-associated DIC
Lastly if overt thromboembolism or organ failure due to clot (i.e. purpura fulminans)
consider low dose anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin pump to switch off
stimulus to coagulation activation. Be mindful that there has been no mortality benefit
of therapeutic anticoagulation and so run aPTT target < 1.5 or anti-Xa levels at a low
rate in DIC. (Levi et al., Blood, 2018)

BACKGROUND
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated clinical syndrome COVID-19 are causing overwhelming morbidity and mortality around the globe, disproportionately affecting New York City. A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking.
METHODS
Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays.
RESULTS
Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNFa. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples.
CONCLUSIONS
We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release. We discuss the involvement of critical regulatory pathways.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the RNA virus causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that has rapidly spread around the globe and already caused more than 1,000,000 documented infections in the United States alone. It has become clear that some patients with COVID-19 develop a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and this may relate to poor outcome. IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab (Actemra) or sarilumab (Kevzara) is being tested for the treatment of COVID-19-associated CRS, given the utility of IL-6 blockade in CRS associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. However, other cytokines such as IL-2, interferon (IFN)-g, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are also elevated in some of these patients.

Injury due to infection of the virus (eg, upper respiratory tract infection);

Coagulopathy (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation); and

Immune injury (eg, cytokine release syndrome).

Usually, COVID-19 is an upper respiratory tract infection but it may progress to involve the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia. In the latter case, emerging evidence suggests that patients who develop more severe disease or die from SARS-CoV-2 infection have two phases of disease.
1
Phase I roughly corresponds to the first week of symptoms and is characterized by high viral load and relatively mild symptoms (
Figure 1
). In phase II, which typically begins 9 to 12 days after symptom onset,
1
patients develop more significant respiratory symptoms and potentially other end-organ damage. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) typically occurs during this stage. Direct myocardial injury can be seen in about 25% of patients with severe disease.
2
A coagulopathy, which may be profound and is poorly understood, may develop. It is thought that viral load during the late phase is lower than in the early phase.

Although the reason for progression in some patients, but not others, is unclear, there is evidence that progression to the late stage is associated with, and possibly driven by, a CRS, as opposed to a direct effect of the virus itself.
3
Why this happens is unclear, but the leading hypothesis is that a deficient early type I/III interferon response during phase I, which may be more likely in elderly patients or those with medical comorbidities, somehow paradoxically predisposes to hypercytokinemia during phase II. It has been hypothesized that mitigation of CRS could reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

Characteristics of CRS in COVID-19 and Treatment with IL-6 Blockade
The immunologic mechanism(s) leading to COVID-19-associated CRS are unclear. Laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19-associated CRS include lymphopenia (T cells in particular), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and pro-calcitonin.
3-5
Studies have suggested that elevated plasma IL-6 levels may be associated with both COVID-19 severity and mortality.
5,6
Several small studies have shown that levels of circulating IL-2, IL-7, IFN-g, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and other cytokines are also elevated in these patients.
7,8
Chemokines such as
CXCL10
(T cells) and monocyte chemokines are also elevated. It is currently not understood if or how CRS is related to the hypercoagulability that develops in some critically ill COVID-19 patients. Mechanistic evaluation of potential links between CRS and the coagulopathy will be informative.

IL-6 blockade has emerged as a potentially promising approach to control COVID-19-associated CRS. There are two FDA-approved IL-6 receptor (IL-6Ra) blockers, tocilizumab and sarilumab. IL-6R blockade holds a theoretical advantage over IL-6 blockers (ie, siltuximab), given its broader activity against different forms of IL-6 signaling. Tocilizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of CRS induced by CAR-T cell cancer therapy, and so this may have been part of the rationale to initially try this drug in COVID-19-associated CRS. Clinical experience with IL-6 blockade in COVID-19 is increasing, and studies to evaluate the efficacy of this therapeutic modality are ongoing. Studies evaluating the utility of blocking the IL-1 signaling axis with drugs such as anakinra (Kineret; IL-1 receptor alpha blocker) are also occurring. In contrast to IL-6, IL-1 is not a JAK- signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) dependent cytokine.

Activity Against COVID-19-associated CRS
An alternate strategy for treating CRS is JAK blockade. JAK inhibitors are orally administered medications that inhibit the activity of cytokines that utilize the JAK-STAT pathway (
Figure 2A
), of which there are greater than 50.
9
IL-6 is a JAK-STAT-dependent cytokine and its activity is blocked by JAK inhibitors.
10
Compared with antibodies targeting a single cytokine or cytokine receptor, JAK inhibitors have the potential advantage of inhibiting the activity of multiple cytokines simultaneously. There are five FDA approved JAK inhibitors: tofacitinib (Xeljanz; JAK1/3>2, for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis), ruxolitinib (Jakafi; JAK1/2, for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera), baricitinib (Olumiant; JAK1/2, for rheumatoid arthritis), upadacitinib (Rinvoq; JAK1, for rheumatoid arthritis), and fedracitinib (Inrebic; JAK2, for myelofibrosis).

Interestingly, many cytokines implicated in COVID-19-associated CRS signal via the JAK-STAT pathway. These cytokines include IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IFN-g (
Figure 2B
). Additionally, the expression of several chemokines that are elevated in COVID-19-associated CRS are regulated downstream of the above JAK-STAT dependent cytokines, and JAK inhibition suppresses their production in in vivo murine models.
11,12

Of the JAK-STAT-dependent cytokines implicated in COVID-19, all but G-CSF and GM-CSF involve JAK1 (
Figure 2B
). G-CSF and GM-CSF signal via JAK2. Therefore, these data suggest that many of the FDA-approved JAK inhibitors may have efficacy in COVID-19-associated CRS.

Antiviral Immunity and JAK Inhibition
JAK proteins regulate signaling downstream of IFN-a/b (type I), IFN-g (type II), and IFN-l (type III), which are essential in antiviral immunity (
Figure 2B
). In light of this, it is interesting that rates of infectious events, including upper respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis, and influenza, are only mildly increased in JAK inhibitor-treated patients (compared to placebo) in clinical trials in various diseases.
13
This seemingly mild impact on antiviral immunity may be because JAK inhibitors, which are administered orally one to two times daily and have short half-lives (hours), largely impact exaggerated cytokine activity, with relative sparing of normal cytokine activity, because drug concentrations are subtherapeutic for part of the day.
14

Potential Treatment of Both COVID-19-associated CRS and Viral Infection
The potential role of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19-associated CRS is clear. However, the ultimate treatment of COVID-19 might be an agent that is effective against
both
viral infection
and
the CRS induced by viral infection. It has been proposed that the JAK inhibitor baricitinib, by virtue of its unique chemical structure (not for its property as a JAK inhibitor), may have the ability to inhibit viral entry into cells. Computer modeling suggested that baricitinib might inhibit proteins potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, including AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1).
15
However, the concentration of baricitinib needed to inhibit AAK1 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis may require doses far above the FDA-approved dose of baricitinib.
16
In any case, the theoretical effect against viral endocytosis only applies to baricitinib and is not a known property of other JAK inhibitors. Additional work will be needed to understand any possible clinical relevance of this observation.

Conclusions
The morbidity and mortality of COVID-19-associated CRS is significant, and effective treatments are direly needed. Given what is presently known, the potential for JAK inhibitor treatment of COVID-19-associated CRS is promising. Indeed, clinical trials with JAK inhibitors in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease are beginning. Despite the potential utility of this drug class in treating hospitalized patients with CRS, it recommended that any patient taking a JAK inhibitor that becomes infected with COVID-19 stop the medication. Most patients with COVID19 do not develop CRS and maintaining effective antiviral immune responses early in infection seems to be essential. Along these lines, treatment of nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease with baricitinib (or continuation of baricitinib), for the (theoretical) purpose of inhibiting viral endocytosis (ie, early in infection), may not be advisable at this point due to the well-characterized activity of all JAK inhibitors in suppressing antiviral interferons. Needless to say, it will be informative to see how the activity of baricitinib compares to other JAK inhibitors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We are optimistic that these, and other studies, will provide novel insights into the pathobiology of this disease and help reduce both mortality and the burden on health care systems globally.

Abstract

The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Cardiovascular disease and, in particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The diagnosis of VTE using standardized objective testing is problematic in these patients, given the risk of infecting non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital personnel, coupled with the usual challenges of performing diagnostic testing in critically-ill patients. Early reports suggest a high incidence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe illness, that is similar to the high VTE rates observed in patients with other viral pneumonias, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).

Ready for COVID-19 -- and Every Chart in the Rack

The name of my column is What to D.O., a perhaps not-particularly-witty combination of my osteopathic credentials and a goal of advocating for new and evidence-informed additions to our therapeutic armaments. Having written for
EMN
for nearly a decade, I've been fortunate enough to have the broad exposure of emergency medicine to drive discussion and content. I use on-shift experience, conversations with friends and colleagues, and even social media to identify areas where we as emergency physicians can explore different ways to grow our profession and scope while refining our routine practice.

As I sit down to write this month's column, though, the intricacy and excitement of traditional emergency medicine seem almost an extravagance, a frivolous distraction from the pressures of the moment. As I type these words in early April, the warming weather and sunny skies belie the devastation within our hospitals.

I've just returned from a stretch of shifts in North Jersey and New York City. I intubated more people in a few days than I can recall doing over the past several months, labored over treatment options and therapeutic maneuvers cloaked in a fog of uncertainty, and declared the final resting time for many souls.

I could write about the litany of therapies and theories that emerge every day. I could soliloquize about what we know or think about hydroxychloroquine. I could discuss the interpolated evidence of azithromycin or the extrapolated applications for remdesivir, Kaletra, sildenafil, Actemra, or convalescent plasma. I could also fall down a rabbit hole of pathophysiologic theories of functional hemoglobinopathies, of altitude sickness, of hypercoagulability; I could pen a lofty dismissal of all but conservative supportive care.

All, though, would be an antiquity by the time of this piece's publication in early June. With any luck, by the time these words find their place, we'll have begun to emerge from the shadows within which we all now find ourselves. We will know much more than we pretend to at the moment, and the early days of summer will bring a slow return to normalcy.

What, Then, to Do?

One of the many important lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the importance of our daily tasks. Sometimes we may begrudge the ceaseless tides that crowd our emergency departments during normal times, but these are the very patients for whom we are needed so frequently. It was a sobering and untimely realization for some of us as volumes plummeted and--at least in some shops across the country--staffing narrowed and hours were cut in response. As the world returns to normal and ED volumes resume their previous patterns, it will become more important than ever that we approach these problems with an unassailable and evidence-based excellence.

As emergency physicians, we know what it means to put the past where it belongs. In normal times, it's an afterthought to move from a cardiac arrest in Room 3 to a sore throat in Room 4. We routinely deliver devastating news or face unthinkable horrors before simply moving on to the next task. We let these moments guide us and learn from their lessons, but the survival of the department--and of our profession--depends on our ability to pick up the next chart in the rack and move forward through the never-ending maw.

As a specialty, emergency medicine reacted quickly and cohesively to COVID-19, bolstering our place as the simultaneous front line and safety net of the health care system. Our capacity to adapt will shine all the more brightly by resuming the critical roles we played before SARS-CoV-2 arrived.

I don't know what will have happened by the time you read this. I don't know if we will have discovered any game-changing therapies or if we'll have flattened the curve and muted the pandemic's effects throughout the nation. I'm not sure how many more emergency physicians will fall as victims of COVID-19 or how many of our families or loved ones will no longer be with us.

I don't know if I'll survive.

What I do know is that all across the country right now, emergency physicians are responding to their communities' calls. EPs from every corner of the map are standing vigil under fluorescent lights, and thousands have already fought the paradigm-defying virus with the same calm and skill they bring to every shift. COVID-19 will bring unprecedented challenges that will meet with unprecedented ability. We will move forward by doing what we do best, by grabbing the next chart in the rack, standing ready to help the next person in need, and providing excellent and evidence-based care for every complaint that we encounter."

A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 develop profound inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction consistent with a ""Cytokine Storm Syndrome"" (CSS). In this review we compare the clinical features, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-CSS with other hematological CSS, namely secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), and CAR-T cell therapy associated Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Novel therapeutics targeting cytokines or inhibiting cell signaling pathways have now become the mainstay of treatment in these CSS. We review the evidence for cytokine blockade and attenuation in these known CSS as well as the emerging literature and clinical trials pertaining to COVID-CSS. Established markers of inflammation as well as cytokine levels are compared and contrasted between these four entities in order to establish a foundation for future diagnostic criteria of COVID-CSS."

Background: COVID-19 is a major pandemic that has killed more than 196,000 people. The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
Methods: In an Institutional Review Board approved study performed at a single, tertiary care academic medical center, the medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. We determined the frequency of VDI among COVID-19 patients to evaluate the likelihood of a VDI-COVID-19 relationship.
Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients with serum 25OHD levels were identified; 65.0% required ICU admission.The VDI prevalence in ICU patients was 84.6%, vs. 57.1% in floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. Coagulopathy was present in 62.5% of ICU COVID-19 patients, and 92.3% were lymphocytopenic.
Conclusions: VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction. Thus, we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.

We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%-11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients.

Conclusions

The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients."

Abstract

Background

The rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has caused more than 3.9 millions of cases worldwide. Currently, there is great interest to assess venous thrombosis prevalence, diagnosis, prevention, and management in patients with Covid-19.

Objectives

Methods

Since March 8
th
, we enrolled 25 patients, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The presence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was systematically assessed by ultrasonography, between day 5 and 10 after admission. The data reported here are those available up until May 9
th
2020.

Results

The mean (+-SD) age of the patients was 68+-11 years, 64% were men. No patients had a history of VTE. During the ICU stay, 8 patients (32%) suffered from VTE; 6 (24%) proximal DVT, 5 (20%) pulmonary embolism. The rate of symptomatic VTE was 24%, while 8% of patients had screen-detected DVT. Only those patients with a documented VTE received a therapeutic anticoagulant regimen. As of May 9
th
, 2020; 5 patients died (20%), 2 remain in the ICU (8%), and 18 were discharged (72%).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, DVT screening at day 5-10 of admission, yielded a 32% prevalence of VTE. 75% of events occurred before screening. Earlier screening might be effective in optimizing care in ICU patients with Covid-19.

Abstract

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 pandemic. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complication among hospitalized patients, is one of the known sequelae of the illness. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are often elderly, immobile, and show signs of coagulopathy. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume a high incidence of VTE among these patients. Presently, the incidence of VTE is estimated at around 25% of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for COVID-19 even under anticoagulant treatment at prophylactic doses. In this review, we discuss present knowledge of the topic, the unique challenges of diagnosis and treatment of VTE, as well as some of the potential mechanisms of increased risk for VTE during the illness. Understanding the true impact of VTE on patients with COVID-19 will potentially improve our ability to reach a timely diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, mitigating the risk for this susceptible population during a complicated disease.

is republishing the consensus in a digital format, along with a new introductory article outlining the DRPU risks posed by PPE and other medical devices used by patients and health professionals during the pandemic, and how the skin damage can be avoided. The aim is to provide frontline staff with a clear, simple strategy on how to prevent the risk of personal skin damage and/or DRPU during the pandemic, as well as point them in the direction of more indepth guidance on long-term strategies for prevention, for both themselves and patients.

Until now, device-related pressure ulcers (DRPUs) and measures to prevent them have been concerned with the effect of devices on patients. However, in the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era, things have changed and it is now health professionals who require help in preventing skin damage and DRPUs. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the effects of DRPUs into sharp focus. With such a considerable global rise in the numbers of patients requiring intensive care and the increased use of prone positioning to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the incidence of DRPU is expected to increase. In addition, a new and common type of DRPU associated with the pandemic appeared among medical workers is that of facial injuries caused by personal protective equipment (PPE). These injuries are primarily caused by medical face masks and goggles, although reports are now emerging of PPE-induced skin damage in other areas including the armpit, groin and extremities.1 The same study, by Jiang et al. published 27 April 2020, reported the overall prevalence of skin injuries caused by PPE in medical staff was 42.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)41.30-44.30%), with three distinct types reported: DRPU; moist-associated skin damage (MASD); and skin tears. Furthermore, logistic regression indicated that sweating (95%CI for odds ratio (OR) 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR 1.61-3.21), being male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13) and wearing grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR 1.08-2.01) were associated with these skin injuries.

This PPE-related tissue damage manifests as a skin wound under the contours of the gear. This skin damage has been described as skin tears, DRPU, friction injury (lesion), irritant contact dermatitis and MASD.

Clearly, in clinical settings, these PPE-related injuries introduce the risk that bacteria, fungi and viruses, including the coronavirus (COVID-19), could penetrate through the skin and reach the bloodstream, with potentially fatal results to the affected health professionals.

This also addresses other medical devices used to treat patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this article is to provide health professionals and non-medical workers with clear and simple guidance on how to prevent the risk of DRPU during this pandemic, as well as to direct them to further indepth information on strategies for prevention of DRPUs, as a update to the consensus document.

Global increase in patients requiring intensive care

Based on data from Italy, 12% of all COVID-19 positive cases required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).
6
The ICU length of stay with this diagnosis is relatively long. As of 5 May 2020, there are over 3.7 million COVID-19 positive cases globally,
7
indicative of approximately 444,000 ICU patients who have added to the healthcare system worldwide in about two months (based on the Italian estimation of 12%).
6
Diagnosis and treatment of each of these new ICU patients will involve at least one (and likely several) of the medical devices and equipment identified in our consensus document,
5
strongly associated with DRPUs (
Table 1
).

A conservative (midrange) estimate of the incidence of DRPUs associated with use of the above equipment in ICUs is 20% and a pessimistic estimate is 40%,
8
which implies that COVID-19 positive patients in ICU could experience between 89,000 and 178,000 hospital-acquired DRPUs in connection with the pandemic. The costs of treating these new wounds, considering again a conservative (midrange) estimate of US$5000 per DRPU case,
9
would be somewhere in the range of US$445-890 million (as of 5 May 2020), without considering indirect costs and possible litigation. In addition, prone position ventilation for sessions of approximately 9-16 hours (in between standard supine ventilation periods) has become a standard of care for COVID-19 positive patients in the ICU with ARDS, to improve their lung mechanics and gas exchange.
10
However, prone positioning applies localised elevated forces to delicate organs and tissue structures, particularly to the facial tissues and eye globes (but also to the breasts for females, the lower costal margins, the anterior iliac crests, the genitalia for males, the knees, the shins and the dorsal foot). Accordingly, COVID-19 positive patients with ARDS who are positioned prone are at a higher risk of DRPUs; the rate of DRPUs acquired in prone position in general is over three times the corresponding risk for supine postures.
11

Use of a protective suit that includes prophylactic dressings to protect the eye globes, forehead and chin, positioners which offer good immersion and envelopment to adequately distribute the head weight, and drying sheets to wick away salivary secretion fluids for moisture management are good clinical practices aimed at reducing the risk of facial DRPUs in prone positioning.
12

The steep rise in the numbers of ICU patients, with the associated increased interactions with risk-causing devices, and the growing use of prone positioning in ICUs to treat ARDS, together make the consensus document
5
pivotal in the current crisis.

Also, it appears that COVID-19 with its fundamental characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome ('cytokine storm'), endothelial dysfunction, drop in oxygen saturation, hypercoagulability leading to microthromboses and potential effects on cardiac output interacts with two of the three primary aetiological factors in DRPUs, i.e. inflammation and ischaemia (

The damage spiral ('vicious cycle') of a device-related pressure ulcer (DRPU) formation. Sustained cell and tissue deformations are always the triggering event and driving cause for the primary tissue damage. Accordingly, alleviating the exposure to sustained tissue deformations (including by means of reducing the coefficient of friction at the skin-device interface using approved lubricants, or redistributing the loads applied by a device using prophylactic dressings) is effective for maintaining the integrity and health of skin

DRPU extended to protective equipment

The current pandemic requires widespread use of PPE, not only by those medical workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, but also, by hospital personnel in the more peripheral areas of care and maintenance, such as receptionists and cleaners, as well as those providing food, security, technical support and other essential services. Hence, the numbers of professionals and service providers now needing to use PPE, which is in continuous contact with skin and, specifically, medical face masks and goggles, has increased remarkably. In parallel, skin tears or friction lesions caused due to intensive use of these types of PPE have been mentioned and photographed extensively in the general media worldwide since the outbreak of the pandemic in China, and in the past several weeks this problem has also begun to be reported in the wound and dermatology literature.

Skin damage caused by PPE may result in COVID-19 infection

Yan et al.
21
identified mucosal membranes as the most common entry for the coronavirus infection, with the otic canal having the lowest risk of transmission. Although early reports from Darlenski and Tsankov
19
that specific skin changes due to COVID-19 infection have not been described, iatrogenic secondary involvement of the skin could be expected. This is now supported by two case reports of cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 on the skin.
22
,
23
Darlenski and Tsankov further highlight that individuals with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lupus, scleroderma and hidradenitis suppurativa, may require immunosuppressive therapy.
19
Health professionals with one of these disorders must be acutely aware of preventing skin damage if they are wearing PPE for prolonged periods of time, and must relieve the mechanical loads applied by this equipment every two hours or less, if there is sensation of discomfort or pain. However, there needs to be a reasonable balance between the DRPU prevention measures taken to protect the skin and the (low, but present) risk of coronavirus infection involved in every change, manoeuvre or manipulation of the PPE. Accordingly, health professionals should also consider the risk of skin damage leading to a portal for infection by the coronavirus against the risk of too rapid, excessively frequent or otherwise unsafe changes of PPE that may lead to infection. This always requires use of good judgment depending on the setting but, generally, health professionals should not bring themselves to a level of pain or injury as a consequence of wearing PPE.

Wang and Parish
24
stated that health professionals wearing PPE for extended periods of time have reported skin changes, most commonly the nasal bridge, cheeks, forehead and hands, including erythema, papules and maceration, leading to burning, itching and stinging and sometimes, to skin tears.

Increased hand washing both for health professionals and the general public has also caused reports of skin irritation and dermatitis; two-thirds of healthcare workers washed their hands more than 10 times a day, but only 22% applied skin protective cream.
25

Injuries due to PPE are DRPUs

The damage cascade occurring at the cell and tissue scales when a DPRU develops is described in detail in the consensus document,
5
for example in the context of wearing a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks which deform the facial soft tissues, indented by the mask contours and which are distorted between the skull structure, nasal cartilage and mask frame. Sustained distortion of the cells residing in these facial tissues causes direct cell-scale damage, which triggers secondary inflammatory damage and tertiary ischaemic damage.
5
This damage spiral is also illustrated in
Fig 1
.

From an aetiological perspective, there is high similarity between the damage caused by CPAP masks and the damage caused due to prolonged use of PPE, especially medical face masks (including N-95 respirators) and protective goggles. The face mask materials, with their relatively stiff flange and straps, and the near rigid goggle frames mechanically indent and damage facial skin.
26

29

Speaking while wearing a mask or goggles, in particular, contracts different facial skeletal muscles and dynamically changes the face topography, which may cause the straps of the PPE to tighten and the mask/goggle frames to frictionally slide upon the facial skin at the contact regions. Hence, skin tissue is exposed to continuous static (strapping) and dynamic (sliding) frictional forces, causing considerable shearing in skin and subdermal tissues. The latter effect is further escalated by profuse perspiration due to the intense mental stress and workload that individuals wearing the equipment are experiencing--the coefficient of friction (COF) between the skin and PPE, and thereby, the magnitudes of the static and dynamic frictional forces at the skin-PPE interfaces rise. Simultaneously, the accumulation of humidity at the skin-PPE interface softens the stratum corneum and dissolves the molecular collagen crosslinks in the dermis.
5
The combination of high frictional forces and weakened structure and function of the skin, result in substantial tissue deformation and cell distortion. These sustained cell and tissue deformations trigger cell death and tissue damage mechanisms described in the consensus document
5
and depicted in
Fig 1
.

There is, however, a fundamental difference between the tissue damage spiral under ventilation masks of an insensate or sedated ICU patient (including patients who are unable to communicate) and the tissue damage potential with respect to PPE applied on the face of healthy medical workers. The extent of tissue damage will be smaller and nearly always reversible under PPE, since a PPE user (who is not a patient) is able to sense and respond to discomfort and pain, and thereby terminate the cycle shown in
Fig 1
. That said, similar to the medical devices for diagnosis or treatment reviewed in the consensus document,
5
PPE has never been optimised for tissue deformation exposures, nor was it designed for such intensive, long-duration and continuous use, and where staff are tightening them even more than necessary to seal their airways and eyes, but at a risk of compromising their skin subdermal health. It should also be noted that single-use face masks were not originally designed to be worn continuously for several hours and or designed to be used when treating different patients without first being changed, so the pattern of use of PPE that has developed due to the shortage of supplies, contributes to the facial skin damage seen among health professionals.

Clinical and biomechanical principles of skin protection applied in practice

Healthy facial skin is more resistant to the compressive and frictional forces applied during prolonged and intensive use of PPE. Loss of facial skin integrity, even on a microscopic scale, creates a portal of entry for pathogens including the coronavirus, but this also applies to other hospital-acquired bacterial, viral or fungal infections.
4
The following information is intended to support health professionals in protecting their facial skin through correct usage habits, application of skin barriers and prophylactic dressings.

Practical recommendations for medical workers

The dos and don'ts in using face masks and goggles Each country has developed and published guidance regarding the use of masks and goggles; this guidance must be adhered to. An example of high-quality and rigorous national guidance is the informative document published by the Portuguese Wound Care Association,
2
which is freely available online in both Portuguese and English versions. The association's work,
2
led by Dr. Paulo Alves, a member of the consensus document's expert panel,
5
has been internationally reviewed by experts (author AG was a member of the international committee overseeing the development of the association's document) and provides excellent, detailed information including graphic examples with regards to specific prophylactic measures. In addition, the World Health Organization offer general advice to health professionals stating that:
30

A medical mask must be worn when entering a room where patients have suspected or confirmed COVID-19

Use a particulate respirator at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health certified N95, European Union standard FFP2, or equivalent, when performing or working in settings where aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation and bronchoscopy are performed.

WHO also provide clear advice regarding appropriate use and dispose of masks to avoid any increase in transmission (
Fig 2
). When putting on a mask:

Place the mask carefully, ensuring it covers the mouth and nose, and tie it securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask

After removal or whenever a used mask is inadvertently touched, clean hands using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water if hands are visibly dirty

Replace masks as soon as they become damp with a new clean, dry mask

Do not reuse single-use masks

Discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removal.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
31
and Public Health England
32
recommend that before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure their PPE is adequate for protection against the risks associated with the specific procedure or task being undertaken. All equipment should be fitted correctly before commencement of any intervention. If possible, masks should be removed every two hours to relieve pressure and shear from the skin. In addition, if masks or any other PPE feels uncomfortable it should be removed as soon as possible in a safe area and the skin should be checked for any signs of damage. Clearly, new equipment should be properly and comfortably mounted before returning to the clinical area.

NHS England
31
further recommend keeping the skin clean and well hydrated, and using a barrier skin wipe/skin protectant if equipment is to be worn for a prolonged period of time to protect against excess moisture. If a moisturising cream is being used, this should be applied at least 30 minutes before applying the PPE. Goggles and face protection (
Fig 3
) should be worn if blood and/or body fluid contamination to the eyes/face is anticipated or likely--for example, by members of a surgical team. Additionally, goggles and face protection should always be used during aerosol generating procedures. It should be emphasised in this context that regular corrective spectacles are not considered eye protection. Any face protection must not be impeded by facial hair or beards, and accessories such as piercings or false eyelashes.

Correct application and removal of goggles

Use of friction-reducing skin protectants

Approved and over-the-counter skin protectants that decrease the COF through lubrication should be an effective, widely available and inexpensive means of reducing the frictional forces applied by PPE on facial skin. Reduction of the COF through lubrication is a simple and straightforward action for lowering the static and dynamic frictional forces delivered by PPE onto skin, as explained above. Clearly, the reduction in the COF should not be too excessive, to avoid the sliding of PPE over the skin. Lowering the COF and the associated frictional forces on the skin will result in less shearing on and within skin tissues and therefore, a lower risk of loss of skin integrity. Biotribology work has confirmed that petroleum jelly (PJ), an approved and affordable skin protectant, decreases the COF of skin by approximately 25% immediately post-application, though the COF value climbs back thereafter, reaching baseline again after about an hour.
33

Other than being a lubricant, during the one-hour timeframe, the applied PJ film appears to be able to hold the perspiration moisture from reaching the skin surface, which further contributes to the reduction in the COF of skin. However, without reapplication, the COF of skin will continue to rise above the basal level, after about an hour from the time of application, likely due to an overshoot effect of perspiration, leading to adhesive friction as the occlusive feature of the PJ film diminishes. Reapplication of the PJ once an hour is critically important, otherwise the aforementioned overshoot effect will elevate the COF of skin substantially above baseline
33
and, therefore, may do more harm than good. Since PJ is solid at room temperature it is easy to apply (and reapply frequently). Fluid lubricants appear to be less optimal for reducing the COF of skin; these include heavy mineral oil (paraffin) which decreases the COF of skin by approximately 18%
33
and fatty acids, such as vegetable oils (including olive oil which is commonly used in cosmetics). The latter may be used as a substitute for PJ for health professionals who are allergic to petroleum-derived products. It is noteworthy that application of PJ or the other aforementioned fluid lubricants would decrease the COF moderately (i.e., at a maximum of approximately 25%) so in practice, the PPE will not tend to slip freely over the face.

Any of these suggested lubricants require frequent reapplication to avoid the 'overshoot effect'. Interestingly, in this regard, a strong correlation was reported between the subjective perception of greasiness and the actual measured reduction in the COF value,
33
indicating that a health professional can judge whether the self-application of a lubricant effectively reduced their facial skin COF. Considering the above information as a whole, applying a thick layer of PJ once every 30 minutes to dry facial skin under the PPE, after a very thorough wash and disinfection of the hands with a hospital-quality sanitary gel product (obviously following removal of used gloves) and using a new mask each time, should be effective in lowering the COF of skin through lubrication and therefore, in decreasing the risk for facial (friction wound) injuries.

In addition, it is important and relevant to note that while it is a common belief that PJ is flammable (because petroleum can be flammable), the PJ that is commercially used as a skin protectant is not flammable. Only when heated to extremely high temperatures of >400deg Fahrenheit or ~200deg Celsius, PJ may release flammable vapours. These temperatures clearly do not occur near the face of healthcare workers in clinical settings. The liquid substitute lubricant, heavy mineral oil, is flammable. Olive oil is relatively involatile and must be heated to its flashpoint temperature (i.e., above 300deg Fahrenheit or 150deg Celsius) or sprayed in a fine mist to be ignited by an open flame. Accordingly, with respect to the flammability aspect, PJ again emerges as the best option for reducing the COF among these different potential lubricants.

Application of PJ, as noted above, would be most effective under fresh PPE; however, if staff are having to reuse face masks, which is commonly seen in the current crisis, PJ can also be reapplied under a reused mask.

Appropriate use of prophylactic dressings

In the context of patient care, our consensus document
3
recommended considering the application of prophylactic dressings under stiff devices to reduce the risk of DRPUs. Such prophylactic dressings have been shown to alleviate the sustained deformations that devices in prolonged contact with skin apply to tissues.
5
We specifically measured forces applied by a CPAP mask onto the skin, following which we used an anatomically-realistic computer model that reconstructs the detailed anatomy of the head and face to determine the resulting skin and deeper tissue loads.
34
We found that facial tissue loads at vulnerable sites were substantially alleviated by prophylactic dressings that were cut to shape to provide localised cushioning. The latter work indicates that similar biomechanical trends of effects would apply with regards to the use of prophylactic dressings for facial tissue protection from PPE, particularly since such dressings will decrease the direct indentation of the stiff PPE elements into facial skin and subdermally.

It is important to note that, at this time, there is no skin protection product in the wound care industry,
35
including prophylactic dressings, that has been specifically and rigorously tested for permeability to the coronavirus. This is a source of debate among health professionals, as to whether applying prophylactic dressings onto sensitive facial sites may compromise the seal of a medical face mask. From a bioengineering perspective, reasonable and sensible use of dressings to protect vulnerable facial areas and the bridge of the nose in particular, is unlikely to compromise the seal, and the example of gaskets from the field of mechanical engineering may be the best to illustrate the reasoning for this. In mechanical engineering, gaskets are always made of flexible and deformable materials, which allow for 'less-than-perfect' shape-mating of touching surfaces (including those with surface irregularities), to eventually form a tight seal. The vast majority of standard face masks (excluding 3D-printed masks that are custom-made for individuals, based on a scan of their face) are produced in standard sizes. Accordingly, standard face masks do not and cannot precisely conform to the anatomical facial contours of each individual, particularly to the curved surfaces of the bridge of the nose. Therefore, by definition, there would always be gaps, however small, between the face and the mask, necessitating very tight strapping, and causing skin indentation, to overcompensate for this. In fact, there is large variability across the global markets with respect to the types and qualities of mask and respirator products. The equipment regarded and regulated as the respiratory protective device with proven air filtration effectiveness (as currently regulated according to EU, US and Chinese standards) classifies a certain minimum percentage (for example, 95%) filtration of airborne particles per class of equipment. The respective testing guidelines always include a respirator fit test which examines whether a respirator properly fits the face of the user, which is achieved by high pressure to the face and the selection of the right respirator size. The following classes of masks/respirators are common:

FFP2 and P2: at least 94% of the airborne particulates are filtered

N95: at least 95% of the airborne particulates are filtered

N99 and FFP3: at least 99% of the airborne particulates are filtered

P3: at least 99.95% of the airborne particulates are filtered.

As an example, filtering facepiece (FFP) protective masks are certified by the EU and serve to protect against particulates, such as dust particles and various airborne viruses.

The fit test performed to assess efficacy is typically subjective and aimed at detecting the ability of the mask/respirator to block particles that have a characteristic smell or taste, for example spraying aqueous solution of saccharin into the air and then asking the subject to indicate whether they are able to taste the sweet aerosol while wearing the mask. This common type of fit test is clearly qualitative and depends on the subjective sensing of the challenge agent. Importantly, the presence of microgaps between the mask/respirator and face which compromise the seal cannot be eliminated based on such qualitative and subjective testing.

It is our opinion that prophylactic dressings with elastic properties which facilitate flexibility and conformation of the dressing structure between the mask and facial contours will alleviate deformations and mechanical stresses in facial tissues
34
and, like gaskets, such dressings may actually improve the seal, rather than compromise it. Dressing materials should also be able to remove trapped heat away from the skin surface to reduce perspiration and the associated risk of skin irritation and maceration.
36
,
37
Confirmation of this, specifically for PPE, through a regular scientific process would require experimental laboratory research and testing, however, university closures including the drawing down of research activities overall in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is slowing down the 'normal' research course.

The present circumstances are highly unusual and health professionals require guidance here and now. The engineering theory described above is a good and solid foundation justifying the use of dressings prophylactically with PPE, so that they act as tight-seal gaskets between the face and PPE, as long as published, peer-reviewed evidence demonstrating their biomechanical efficacy exists. The above also indicates that dressings that appear to be either too thick or too stiff so that they cannot conform to the contours of the face under the mask, may compromise the seal. Clearly, excessively thick or stiff dressings will also be less effective in protecting the integrity of facial skin, as they cannot dissipate the loading applied by the PPE through self-deformation which relieves the loads in the facial tissues.

Finally, the effects of prophylactic dressings applied as skin protectants under PPE may be very different with the various available types of masks/respirators reviewed above. Characterising the biomechanical efficacy, including the 'gasket function' of dressings under different PPE types, will require additional research.

Practical recommendations for non-medical workers

The general public may wish to wear masks outside the home, as these will generally not be worn for prolonged periods of time or overtightened in response to an immediate threat of infection--as occurs with health professionals. Hence, there is minimum risk of skin damage caused by moisture, shear and friction to the general public. Masks used by the general public will also not necessarily be the same as those being worn by health professionals in medical facilities. Of note is that there is continued debate regarding the effectiveness of wearing these masks by the general public, and many countries have produced advice, including the WHO, which has stated that the wide use of masks by healthy people in community settings is not supported by current evidence, and carries uncertainties and critical risks.
30
However, the use of masks does suggest potential advantages, including a reduction in potential exposure in healthy people in the community setting, including reducing potential exposure risk from an infected person during the 'pre-symptomatic' period. Additionally, the CDC have recommended wearing cloth face coverings in public settings, particularly where there are reports of significant community-based transmission and where other social distancing measures may be difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies.
38
At present, a few countries, for example, Singapore, Austria and Israel instructed mandatory use of masks in public spaces; however other countries such as Australia and New Zealand, have instructed against the use of face masks in public by the general public. Evidence for the use of face masks by the public is lacking, although some would argue that the precautionary principle should be used and the use of face masks advised.
39

WHO currently only recommends face masks for people who are coughing or sneezing, or for those who are caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. The CDC recommends cloth masks fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, should be secured with ties or ear loops, include multiple layers of fabric, allow for breathing without restriction, and be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.
38
Masks should be laundered daily in a washing machine.
38
When wearing a mask, it is essential that people do not inadvertently self-contaminate by touching and reusing contaminated masks, and that hands are washed immediately after removing the mask.
38

Guidance for industry and other stakeholders

Industry and regulatory bodies should already have substantial real-world information to analyse and use in developing better technologies, products and testing standards that will expand the scope of requirements from PPE, to not only provide filtering of air and a good seal but also minimise the risk of skin damage. There are short-term steps and long-term solutions that will be required, as healthcare systems prepare for the next waves of COVID-19 and potentially, future pandemics. Specifically, in the short-term, manufacturers should publish instructions for use (IFU) that consider skin damage due to prolonged and intensive application of PPE products. Ideally, such IFU would guide users not only in the mounting and removal of the equipment, but also with regards to skin care.

In the longer-term, quality indicators need to be developed by bioengineers to evaluate the level of conformation of PPE on facial contours so that, even for products made in standard sizes, it would be possible to assess the extent of adjustability of the product to the individual. Likewise, kits of personalised fit equipment, such as skin barriers and prophylactic dressings, can be developed for the specific purposes of delivering skin protection without compromising the seal. Such new products can be tested in bioengineering laboratory work using head phantoms designed to evaluate the PPE and the corresponding IFU. The phantom systems will simultaneously test the quality of the seal, the level of air filtration, the mechanical forces applied by the equipment on (simulated) facial skin and subdermal tissues, and the heating caused by the equipment, thereby facilitating relative assessments across existing, improved or future PPE products. Computer modelling can be added to that and, using such an integrative, experimental-computational approach, provide additional important information in a safe, cost-effective and reproducible manner; for example, predicting the expected viral load in cases of equipment failure, malfunction or inadequate use. This bioengineering approach is currently completely absent with respect to PPE, which is typically being evaluated using subjective measures such as fit testing that assesses the ability to smell or taste an aerosol while using the equipment. As an analogue to the case of DRPUs in patient care, there is lack of objective, quantitative and standardised measures regarding how safe specific types of PPE are, from a skin and tissue health perspective. While work concerning the safety of device designs has already started to appear in the literature and is reviewed in the consensus document,
5
there is no equivalent published bioengineering information related to PPE. Academicians, clinicians, industrialists and regulatory professionals need to work closely together to bridge this gap effectively and promptly.

Summary: the consensus document is more relevant now than ever

While in the context of patient care, the concept of DRPUs is clear and drives a constant need (though often unmet) for clinical and biomechanical information regarding prophylaxisprevention, the projected consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic makes the consensus document
3
more relevant than ever, for a number of reasons. First, there is a steep rise in the numbers of ICU patients and an associated increase in interactions of these patients with risk-causing devices, together with growing use of prone positioning in ICUs. This will lead to a proportional escalation in the absolute numbers of DRPUs among these patients. In addition, it appears that COVID-19, with its fundamental characteristics of a cytokine storm--endothelial dysfunction, drop in oxygen saturation, hypercoagulability leading to microthromboses and potential effects on cardiac output--interacts with two of the three primary aetiological factors in DRPUs, inflammation and ischemia (
Fig 1
).
16
,
17
,
18
This introduces an inherently increased fragility of soft tissues among COVID-19 positive patients, resulting from the above-listed pathophysiological components of the disease that together contribute to amplifying the DRPU tissue damage spiral (
Fig 1
). Considering their greater tissue fragility, the segment of COVID-19 positive patients who will eventually suffer ICU-acquired DRPUs is expected to exceed the DRPU rates observed in the same ICUs before the pandemic. Second, and added to the above, we are seeing a new type of DRPU that has the same known underlying pathophysiology (
Fig 1
) but which affects a different population--health workers (as well as others who use PPE intensively). This population was not previously considered to be at a risk for DRPUs.

Photographs showing the routine of life during the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918 prove how little has changed in the design of the most basic form of PPE, the medical face mask. In our consensus document,
3
we discuss in detail the consequences of the newly developed understanding of the aetiology of PUs, and DRPUs in particular, identifying sustained cell and tissue deformation as the triggering event and driving factor in the injury cascade (
Fig 1
). Similar to the bioengineering design of numerous types of medical devices, the designs of PPE, and especially of respirators and goggles, will need to be revisited thoroughly when the first wave of the pandemic ends, to incorporate improvements related to the PPE-skin interactions. As discussed in the consensus document,
5
these improvements in PPE should include use of stiffness-matched materials that do not aggressively indent the skin, low COF at skin-PPE interfaces and effective release of trapped heat and moisture from these interfaces.

Abstract

The SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has already claimed over 200,000 lives. Quite early on in this pandemic, it was recognised that the virus triggers the immune system leading to a cytokine storm in some severely ill patients [1]. This hyper-responsiveness has been suggested to be the predominant aetiology for clinical deterioration and mortality in patients with this infection [2]. More recently, there have been several reports of increased thrombotic events in these patients [3-6]. From a laboratory perspective, this hypercoagulability is reflected in the marked elevation of the fibrinolytic marker, D-dimer, in almost all hospitalised COVID-19 patients [7]. We must, therefore, ask ourselves what is the link between the extremes of the immune system, presenting as cytokine storm, and the extremes of coagulation, presenting as arterial and venous thromboembolism?

Hypercoagulability is indeed a significant issue in Covid-19, and the hemostatic system is shifted markedly toward the procoagulant side in these patients. However, we cannot yet be certain that unfractionated heparin (UFH) is better than low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in this scenario. Although UFH has been used for several years, it does have practical issues, mainly with respect to the need for frequent monitoring using activated partial thromboplastin time.
1
,
2
In addition, as the authors pointed out correctly, markedly increased acute phase reactants including fibrinogen could contribute to heparin resistance making the use of UFH problematic (much more than LMWH).
2
Among the reasons for heparin resistance, antithrombin deficiency is not common in Covid-19 patients, at least in the published literature.
3
Despite these issues, UFH may still be preferred if there is marked renal impairment or need for reversibility for an urgent intervention.
4
One of the latter situations is if the patients progress despite anticoagulant therapy. The authors of the letter had recently published a case series on the use of tissue plasminogen activator in C,-19 patients which is certainly a consideration in patients who progress despite anticoagulant therapy.
5

At the time of writing the interim document, our aim was to highlight the urgent need to consider thromboprophylaxis in all patients who require hospital admission for Covid-19 to mitigate poor outcomes from the marked hypercoagulability. We do recognize that, since then, it has frequently been suggested that higher doses of LMWH be given to Covid-19 patients to prevent venous thromboembolism. However, there is no demonstration that standard prophylactic doses are insufficient to prevent it. Pulmonary vessel occlusions that are observed in severe Covid-19 patients are caused by pulmonary thrombi, whose pathogenesis is unclear but likely to be associated with the severe pulmonary inflammation. Concerning the type of heparin, we cannot be certain that one type is better than the other; in other words, it is difficult to say UFH is better than LMWH. LMWH was chosen in the guidance because of the ease of use, no need for laboratory monitoring, and familiarity among the spectrum of doctors with varying experience. The question of whether
therapeutic
doses of either UFH or LMWH should be considered for all patients is currently unknown and the authors would currently reserve such a dose for those who have confirmed thrombosis including filter thrombosis. We are aware however that therapeutic dose is being administered in some centers where there is very high suspicion of pulmonary embolism and imaging is impractical. Although these approaches are reasonable, we stress that these approaches are undertaken in a trial setting.

Abstract

Background

Infection by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reportedly associated with a high risk of thrombotic complications. So far information is scarce and rapidly emerging.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review using a single engine search for studies assessing thrombosis and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Additional studies were identified by secondary review and alert services.

Results

Studies reported the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and stroke in approximately 20% and 3% of patients, respectively. A higher frequency seems to be present in severely ill patients, in particular those admitted to intensive care units. The thrombotic risk is elevated despite the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis but optimal doses of anticoagulation are not yet defined. Although an increase of biomarkers such as D-dimer has been consistently reported in severely ill COVID-19, the optimal cut-off level and prognostic value are not known.

Discussion

A number of pressing issues were identified by this review, including defining the true incidence of VTE in COVID patients, developing algorithms to identify those susceptible to develop thrombotic complications and severe disease, determining the role of biomarkers and/or scoring systems to stratify patients' risk, designing adequate and feasible diagnostic protocols for PE, establishing the optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy, and developing uniform diagnostic and reporting criteria."

Abstract

The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wide, ranging from minor, non-specific symptoms to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ involvement and shock [1-3]. In severe cases, the cytokine storm following the viral infection precipitates an acute systemic inflammatory response and diffuse endothelial damage, which may, in combination with hypoxia, immobilization and underlying risk factors, result in potentially life-threatening venous and arterial thrombotic events [4-6]. In fact, clinical and laboratory findings reported in patients with COVID-19 since the beginning of this outbreak frequently include hemostatic abnormalities, which have been associated with an unfavorable in-hospital outcome in preliminary reports [7-9].

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is problematic as no one has prior immunity, and no specific antiviral treatments are available. While many people with COVID-19 develop mild to moderate symptoms, some develop profound, seemingly unchecked inflammatory responses leading to acute lung injury and hypoxemic respiratory failure, the most common cause of death. The interplay between inflammation and coagulation--thromboinflammation--has been well described, and recently reviewed.

COVID-19 infection is associated with coagulation abnormalities characterized by increases in procoagulant factor levels including fibrinogen, and increases in D-dimers that have been associated with higher mortality.

Recent published and other reports note what appears to be an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19. Klok et al reported a 27% (95% confidence interval 17-37) VTE incidence and 3.7% arterial vascular events despite the use of standard weight based VTE prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
8
Of note, the failure rate for standard VTE prophylaxis in an ICU setting is 7.7%.
9
Cui et al report a similar 25% incidence of VTE in China, but VTE prophylaxis was not given, as the incidence of VTE in Asian populations is very low, therefore VTE prophylaxis not routinely used.
10
,
11
In addition to increased VTE incidence, published pathology reports and verbal communications have identified both microvascular thrombosis and pulmonary emboli at autopsy in the small number of patients currently reported. The microvascular thrombosis is seen in an environment of marked inflammatory changes including mononuclear cell infiltrates, virally infected cells, and diffuse alveolar damage (
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20050575v1
, accessed April 12, 2020).

In this issue of the
Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis
, Rannuci and colleagues report on coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients including interleukin 6 levels, fibrinogen, D-dimers, and viscoelastic testing in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
12
Baseline testing on admission in 16 patients receiving 4000 international units (IU) nadroparin twice daily included prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, D-dimer, and viscoelastic measurements. Initial results were similar to other reports, with the median fibrinogen level elevated above the upper limit of normal. Despite normal clotting times on viscoelastic testing, other indices demonstrated increased clot firmness with above normal values for contributions from fibrinogen (94%) and platelets (62%), after which time nadroparin dosing was empirically increased to 6000 or 8000 IU BID if body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m
2
. Two patients were treated with antithrombin concentrates for levels < 70% and one patient was treated with clopidogrel 75 mg/day for a platelet count > 400 000/uL. Follow up standard coagulation test results were available for 10 patients over 7 days of the increased dose, and 9 had a second viscoelastic test after 2 weeks of increased LMWH.

The use of an increased prophylactic dose of nadroparin resulted in a significant decrease in D-dimer levels although all patients still had values above the normal range. Similarly, viscoelastic testing suggested decreased hypercoagulability after increasing LMWH as Rannucci et al show in figure 2, and decreases in clot firmness as a result of a decreased contribution from fibrinogen and platelets to varying degrees. One important finding from this report is the correlation of Il-6 and fibrinogen levels, demonstrating and confirming the link between inflammation and pro-coagulant changes. All patients had IL-6 levels far above the upper limit of normal at admission.

The major cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS, is mediated by lung injury caused by the invading pathogen. Viral infection has been demonstrated in multinucleated cells on autopsy in the alveoli of COVID-19 infected patients.
13
The primary infection initiates alveolar injury and the resulting inflammatory response, including production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, which has been demonstrated to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, as well as activation and recruitment of mononuclear cells and neutrophils causing more tissue damage, including damage to the capillary endothelium. In addition to the procoagulant effectors derived as the result of inflammation (including cytokines, neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs], polyphosphates) the usual thrombo-protective state of the vascular endothelial cells is disrupted; both pathophysiologic changes lead to the development of microvascular thrombosis. Over time the pathology of ARDS progresses to a proliferative and then ultimately a fibrotic state, which is ultimately fatal.

Rannuci et al's report suggests that an increased prophylactic LMWH dose appears to dampen the downstream thrombotic results of the marked inflammatory response to COVID-19. Although patient improvement with viral clearance and decreased inflammatory effects may have occurred and been responsible for some of the changes, despite the decrease in D-dimers the fibrinogen values were still elevated, and the mortality in this small number of patients with ARDS was high. Whether intervening earlier with anticoagulants before patients develop ARDS would make a difference, or whether preventing the microvascular thrombosis will change outcomes remains to be determined. Certainly, it is possible as suggested by Rannuci et al that using increased doses of LMWH might halt the progression to overt DIC as well as mitigate the contribution of microvascular thrombosis to the hypoxemic respiratory failure.

For clinicians trained in using an evidence-based medicine approach, we find ourselves forced to practice without data. Is an empiric increase in prophylactic anticoagulation dose justified with the limited data we have? Despite the small numbers reported, the use of increased LMWH dose was not associated with increased bleeding. Precedent exists in other clinical situations in which patients are considered at a high risk for VTE, for the use of an off-label increased dose of enoxaparin 40 mg (4000 IU) or 60 mg every 12 hours based on BMI for post-bariatric surgery patients, or in pregnancy where increased doses are advised for prophylaxis with minimal supporting data.
14
,
15
Some guidance documents from around the world suggest using standard coagulation test values to determine anticoagulant dosing for COVID-19, as suggested in a French guidance document, which recommends full therapeutic dose anticoagulation for patients with increased fibrinogen > 8 g/L or D-dimer > 3.0 ug/mL (
https://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2020/04/03/covid-19-gihp-gfht-3-avril-final-3/?
, accessed April 13, 2020). While Klok and colleagues reported using a standard dose of 2850 IU nadroparin daily, with 5700 IU daily for those weighing over 100 kg, the mean weight was 87 kg +- 16, with few patients weighing more than 100 kg. The Netherlands centers changed practice after a month of experience treating COVID-19 patients; nadroparin doses were increased to 5700 IU daily regardless of weight at one center, and at another center the dose was increased to 5700 IU twice a day, very similar to the escalated dose used by Rannuci et al.
8
,
12
These increased doses may be required to overcome the dramatic elevation in levels of procoagulant factors such as fibrinogen, factor VIII, and others, that are not present in the standard post arthroplasty or hospitalized medically ill patient.

In COVID-19 patients, a risk adapted approach to escalating the dose of anticoagulation despite minimal supporting data should be carefully considered after assessing the bleeding risk for each patient. Monitoring fibrinogen, PT, PTT, and renal function should be performed. However, increasing anticoagulant doses alone is likely insufficient to change outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 acute lung injury. Additional therapy with novel anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-6 and Il-1 antagonists, and other approaches to treating the cytokine storm that appears to be responsible for severe and fatal infections, may be critical to decrease the thromboinflammatory responses and subsequent tissue injury that drive the prothrombotic changes resulting in microvascular thrombosis and overt VTE. Anticoagulation might play a role by preventing the contribution of microvascular thrombosis to the progression of respiratory failure, giving time for anti-inflammatory agents to work to decrease damage and to allow innate immunity to clear the virus. As with anticoagulation dosing, multiple anti-inflammatory agents are being used with similar lack of data to guide care. While randomized controlled trials are the ideal, and are being developed or are under way for both anti-inflammatory therapies and anticoagulants, the exponentially increasing numbers of infected patients and the rapid pace of the disease leave little time for many to participate in well-conducted studies. However, the report by Rannuci et al provide important insight into the hypercoagulability and thromboinflammatory response associated with COVID-19 and acute lung injury, and may provide some perspective on additional therapeutic strategies to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.

Abstract

We report three cases of severe thrombocytopenia during COVID-19 infection associated with either cutaneous purpura or mucosal bleeding. The initial investigations ruled out other causes of thrombocytopenia. Two of the patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and eltrombopag, while the third recovered spontaneously. A good clinical and biological response was achieved in all patients leading to hospital discharge."

1
]. We would like to make some comments. They quoted several studies, including one from Knaup et al., in order to support their argument [
2
]. They assert that TPE is unique by offering benefit on multiple levels by removing inflammatory cytokines, stabilizing endothelial membranes, and resetting the hypercoagulable state [
1
]. Knaup et al. stated that a major difference between TPE and modern extracorporeal adsorption strategies is based on the fact that the exchange of septic shock plasma with fresh frozen plasma may not lead to an unselective depletion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and will rather replenish protective factors (within FFPs) that have been consumed by the sepsis [
2
]. It is currently impossible when employing an unselective removal technique to know if we are doing something good by removing an excess of pro-inflammatory mediators or something wrong by removing anti-inflammatory mediators. At this time, we are unable to clearly identify at the bedside which patients are in a pro-inflammatory state that could kill them or an anti-inflammatory state that could help them to survive. The fact that the inflammation is huge during COVID-19 does not justify the non-selective removal of inflammation components, when some elements may be saving patients. TPE also has the potential to cause harm by diluting or attenuating the host's adaptive response to infection by depletion of immunoglobulins and complement component 3 and 4 in individuals treated with plasmapheresis [
3
]. Importantly, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, TPE will remove the protective antibodies formed by the patient, which is not desirable. In conclusion, TPE may not restore immune homeostasis but may rather aggravate immunoparalysis [
4
]. We agree with the authors that this outbreak should serve as an impetus to investigate therapies targeting the pathways that lead to morbidity and mortality in these syndromes [
1
]. This does not mean that we have received a signed blank check to start a therapy without deeply reviewing the rationale and the quality of existing data.

Authors' response

We appreciate Dr. Honore's interest and his insight, and we share his concerns regarding the need to be cautious. The points made in the letter are valid and warrant further investigation. The intent of our editorial was not to protocolize the use of TPE in sepsis and/or COVID-19, rather to highlight its potential and to encourage further study [
1
].

The COVID pandemic has been an eye-opening and humbling experience. Currently, there are no proven treatments for this disease. A number of therapies have been/are being investigated, but early results have been disappointing. Critically ill patients with COVID continue to die at an alarming rate--a recent case series published in JAMA reported 88.1% mortality for patients requiring mechanical ventilation in a large health care system in New York [
5
].

Altering the host immune response certainly comes with risk, and most patients who survive do so without direct alteration of this pathway. However, when ""dysregulated,"" this response may lead to refractory hypotension with shock, multiple organ failure, ARDS, and/or death. Therapies targeting specific components continue to be explored, but none have proven to be efficacious thus far (including during the current COVID pandemic). Readily available laboratory testing has not allowed for identification of patients likely to benefit (or those likely to worsen). At this time, in the absence of more specific labs, the clinician's challenge of evaluating patients and making the most appropriate treatment decisions must mainly be guided by the clinical parameters, as determined by currently available resources and evidence.

We submitted our editorial because of enthusiasm for TPE as a potential supportive and adjunctive treatment for select critically ill, septic patients. We agree to suggest its promotion as a panacea, deserving of a blank check, would be a gross overstatement. TPE has not been appropriately studied, despite decades of evidence suggesting a potential benefit. We feel that the medical community has a responsibility to investigate its role as adjunctive therapy, through well-designed clinical trials.

Abstract

The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.

Abstract

The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Reports from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients. Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system."

Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its assessment of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. However, specific antiviral drugs are still unavailable, and pateints are managed by multiple complementary treatments.
Methods The electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients where basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines and serum biochemical indicators in 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and 21 without LMWH) that were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the effect of LMWH treatment on disease progression.
Findings 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital between February 1 and March 15, 2020, were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (LMWH group), and 21 did not (Control), during hospitalization. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.011, respectively). Changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.002;p=0.035). Strikingly, in the LMWH group, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (p=0.006). Besides, the changes in IL-6 levels in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.031).
Interpretation LMWH improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte %. It appears that LMWH can be used as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical trial.

Abstract

The wide spectrum of symptoms observed in COVID-19 appears to defy explanation. Apart from geographic limitation to people with prior exposure to other coronaviruses and air pollutants, inflammatory comordidities and older ages are also among the main factors of susceptibility to severe illness. The unusual epidemiological data pointed out in children and African territories have revealed new insights in host-pathogen interplay with more focus on epigenetic regulation of cognitive compartments belonging to innate immunity. Should trained immunity be proven to be involved in timely immune responsiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and that adaptive memory could be detrimental, both treatment regimens and vaccine design will tremendously change accordingly with more focus on upper respiratory tissue innate immunity to subdue this threat underway.

A comprehensive review of the neurological disorders reported during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscle. CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barre syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic. International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the natural history of this worldwide problem."

COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Thought to be of zoonotic origin, it has been named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and has spread rapidly. As of April 20, 2020, there have been >2.4 million cases recorded worldwide. The inflammatory process, cytokine storm, and lung injury that are associated with COVID-19 can put patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. The total incidence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients is currently uncertain. Those with more severe disease and with other risk factors, including increasing age, male sex, obesity, cancer, comorbidities, and intensive care unit admission, are at higher risk of these events. However, there is little international guidance on managing these risks in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we explore the current evidence and theories surrounding thrombosis in these unique patients and reflect on experience from our center.

Background. COVID-19 infection has limited preventive or therapeutic drug options at this stage. Some of common existing drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been hypothesised to impact on disease severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older people residing in nursing homes. The purpose of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older people residing in nursing homes.
Methods and Findings. We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study in two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 diagnoses were based on clinical suspicion and/or viral presence using PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified. The outcomes were defined as 1) serious COVID-19 defined as a long-stay hospital admission (length of stay >= 7 days) or death (at hospital or nursing home) within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Disease symptoms were defined as any COVID-19-related clinical symptom (e.g. coughing, dyspnoea, sore throat) or sign (low oxygen saturation and fever) for >= 2 days out of 3 consecutive days.
Logistic regression models with Firth corrections were applied on these 154 subjects to analyse the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with the outcomes. Age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension were used as covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of our statistical significant findings.
We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 infection (unadjusted OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71; p=0.011), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, functional status, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The strength of this association was considerable and clinically important. Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome (long-stay hospitalisation or death) were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.25-1.85; p=0.556). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 1.52; CI 0.62-3.50; p=0.339) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.79; CI 0.26-1.95; p=0.629).
Conclusions. Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail people could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. The role of statins and any interaction with renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.

Introduction, objectives and systematic observations

The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global concern with 4,369,410 confirmed infections and 297,569 total deaths since the first reported outbreak of the infection (

]. While COVID-19 is primarily a viral respiratory illness, it is proven to have systemic manifestations, most notably coagulation complications, in those with severe disease.

During this unprecedented, global COVID-19 instigated health-crisis, characterized by closed borders, travel restrictions, and at times complete lockdown, we have seen an inspiring response from the scientific community. To understand the current state of discourse, we searched the literature addressing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, PubMed and the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) databases were searched, from the earliest available report 19
th
February 2020 to 7
th
May 2020. We aimed to evaluate the scope and quantity of publications during this period with key terms relating to Coronavirus, coagulopathy, thromboembolic disease, anticoagulant and thrombocytopenia. The other inclusion criteria were Haemostasis and Thrombosis topics in English language, journals with an Impact factor of more than 3 and Haemostasis Specialist journals. The search yielded 586 papers of which 103 were finally included after removing duplicates, inspecting the abstracts and full-text reviews. These are listed in
Table 1
according to the journal of publication. Of note, whilst 23 reports documented original findings, the remaining 78 consisted of comments, editorials, letters, expert reviews, and guidelines.

Table 1

th
February 2020 to 7
th
May 2020. The table shows the names of journals and number and types of publications.

Evidence continues to accumulate as COVID-19 infections escalate, and as more countries present their findings. It is important to note that much of the global data consists of cross-sectional or retrospective reports, with unmeasured, and sometimes underappreciated confounding. While initial reports remain important, our understanding is constantly evolving, with event rates influenced by multiple factors including over-representation of critically ill patients, use of investigational drugs, and a multitude of studies lacking a control group, to name a few.

Earlier studies have noted an association between an abnormal coagulation profile (consistent with the definition of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) previously endorsed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)), and subsequent poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection [

This volatile context has triggered fierce discussions amongst the Haemostasis community, beginning with the type and mechanism of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and thrombo-embolic risk, spanning the indications for thromboprophylaxis, and extending to the merits and hazards of therapeutic anticoagulation [

As an example, d-dimer was posited as a critical parameter/indicator of thrombotic complication associated with COVID-19. Debates on cut-off values and links to disease-severity and mortality were reported according to diverse patients' presentations, spanning countries, and incorporating varying hospital practices, and accounting for ethnic variability [

]. Deliberation surrounding the merits of using d-dimer as a prognostic indicator in the setting of COVID-19 generated metanalyses that were published earlier than would typically be expected in non-pandemic conditions [

]. During these times of myriad uncertainties, debate predominates and social media platforms such as Twitter continue to be filled with puzzled physicians asking crucial questions about anticoagulation dosing as it relates to the severity of infection or d-dimer levels. Discourse on the value of prophylactic low molecular weight anticoagulation also draws on recommendations from international guidelines [

]. Despite the limited data, the high-stakes milieu and risk of litigation have led several institutions to adopt a more aggressive approach of using intermediate or full-dose anticoagulation for most of their critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit [

]. This approach has been tempered by others who have utilised the state of clinical equipoise as a catalyst for collaboration to initiate multicenter Randomised Control Trials (NCT04362085, NCT04345848, NCT04360824, NCT04377997) to more conclusively answer these questions.

The dissemination of knowledge during times of international crisis is guided by the principles first set out in the World Health Organization's 2016 statement on data-sharing during public health emergencies, which incorporated lessons from the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and was undersigned by many notable foundations and journals [

]. The statements implore researchers, journals and funders to expeditiously publish findings relevant to the outbreak, and to ensure these are available free-of-charge, through preprint servers prior to journal publication or as open-access prior to peer-review.

2.
Journals' and authors' responsibilities

Academic engagement and advancement of knowledge through increased research output and through extension of open-access policies by medical journals that waive fees to enable and broaden data access has been remarkable, contributing a great deal to the goal of improving outcomes for those affected by the disease [

Peer-review is an essential quality-assurance process, invaluable to the integrity of scientific work. However; it does have the potential to result in delays during crucial moments of an outbreak, where mere hours may make a difference with respect to dissemination of newly acquired insights. In order to maintain this important quality-assurance measure, we are hoping journal editors have adapted their policies to expedite responses, while consistently upholding their high-standards.

Authors likewise must continue to hold in high-regard their responsibility to maintain the trust of various stakeholders and the public [

]. Authors must remain cognizant of the absolute need to maintain credibility before the scientific community and to exercise caution with what they submit for publication.

Globally, it is our obligation to treat open-access science with great care. To achieve this, responsible debate and disagreement, and honest yet courteous critique provide a platform for a range of opinions to be expressed [

]. Medical journals afford readers the opportunity to submit comments, questions, or criticisms pertaining to published work. The discourse can be passionate and enlightening, exposing new perspectives for further deliberation. Yet in the midst of a deadly crisis, acknowledgement of the circumstances is paramount, and consideration of the underlying pressures more important than ever. Providing the necessary feedback in a respectful and considerate manner, tempered by humanity and kindness for our colleagues, their efforts, and the integrity of their work cannot be underestimated.

SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the recognition of the effects and outcomes of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, bringing with it urgency for enhanced understanding, to improve current management strategies and save lives. There are both benefits and risks fast-tracked publications on COVID-19, particularly as insights emerge at a record pace. It is imperative to keep in mind that opinions provided based on initial data may need to evolve as new details are reported. For most journals, the risks of missing out, becoming quickly outdated, or potentially being recognized as flawed need to be balanced by the benefits of rapid response to serve the scientific community, to stimulate new ideas and further work, and to maintain leadership in the filed.

3.
The balance

Accounting for both perspectives, a pragmatic approach is to enable publications, courteous critique and debate, but to also tighten the peer-review process to ensure publication of quality science. Additionally, in the interests of relevance and fairness, and to keep correspondence manageable, journals may wish to consider setting time limits and rules of conduct to guide responses to published material and to govern debate on a given topic. A critical tenet of any scientific debate, which must be upheld in these scary and fast-moving times, is the need to maintain respect for others' scientific output, to trust in their
bona fide
intentions, and to exercise a humane and dignified manner with which to provide constructive critique. It is likewise important to harness this opportunity to develop innovative collaborations between dedicated professionals, rather than propagating competition. The vulnerability of the world and of humanity is a clear lesson imparted by COVID-19. It would behoove all of us to espouse the metaphoric ""we are all in the same boat"" scenario and to build supportive teams in the true spirit of collaboration. We should strive to ensure that the positive outcome of this pandemic is a sound foundation for long-term relationships that aim to improve International standards and consensus.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is predicted to overwhelm health care capacity in the United States and worldwide, and, as such, interventions that could prevent clinical decompensation and respiratory compromise in infected patients are desperately needed. Excessive cytokine release and activation of coagulation appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 pneumonia and associated mortality. Contact activation has been linked to pathologic upregulation of both inflammatory mediators and coagulation, and accumulating preclinical and clinical data suggest it to be a rational therapeutic target in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacologic inhibition of the interaction between coagulation factors XI and XII has been shown to prevent consumptive coagulopathy, pathologic systemic inflammatory response, and mortality in at least 2 types of experimental sepsis. Importantly, inhibition of contact activation also prevented death from
Staphylococcus aureus
-induced lethal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in nonhuman primates. The contact system is likely dispensable for hemostasis and may not be needed for host immunity, suggesting it to be a reasonably safe target that will not result in immunosuppression or bleeding. As a few drugs targeting contact activation are already in clinical development, immediate clinical trials for their use in patients with COVID-19 are potentially feasible for the prevention or treatment of respiratory distress.

Contact activation inhibitors in clinical development could be tested in patients with COVID-19.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may succumb to a systemic cytokine release syndrome, which has prompted therapeutic trials of biologic agents targeting interleukin (IL)-6 (tocilizumab, sarilumab) and other inflammatory mediators. A single-arm study of tocilizumab in 20 patients with severe or critical COVID-19-related pneumonia undertaken during the outbreak in China reported a reduction in oxygen requirements and improvement in pulmonary imaging in 75% and 90% of patients, respectively.
1
The US Food and Drug Administration has since approved a phase 3 clinical trial of tocilizumab (Actemra, Genentech) in patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia.
2

Dysregulated coagulation with hypercoagulability is common with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A retrospective analysis of patients admitted with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection found that 71.4% of patients who ultimately died from COVID-19 developed overt DIC compared with only 0.6% of survivors. On admission, nonsurviving patients presented with higher D-dimer levels and prolonged prothrombin times and activated partial thromboplastin times compared with surviving patients.
3
Furthermore, recent retrospective analyses have suggested that anticoagulation with heparin may improve clinical outcomes in patients with critical COVID-19,
4
and autopsy reports from patients who died from severe COVID-19-related respiratory failure note intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation, suggesting a loss of vascular integrity.
5

Pathologic upregulation of inflammation and coagulation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to significant enthusiasm for mobilizing clinical trials targeting either pathway.
6
In this paper, we propose that targeting contact activation is a rational target for clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 at risk for respiratory compromise based on (i) animal models showing that inhibiting contact activation prevents pathologic host inflammatory responses to certain infections or bacterial challenge; (ii) clinical rationale that inhibiting contact activation may be safe in critically ill patients and is unlikely to provoke significant bleeding or compromise the immune system; and (iii) several contact activation inhibitors are in clinical development and are potentially available for rapid clinical trial implementation.

2 THE CONTACT PATHWAYS OF COAGULATION AND INFLAMMATION

The molecular complex of contact activation composed of factor XII (FXII), factor XI (FXI), prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen serves as a central node linking the coagulation and inflammation pathways (Figure
1
). Contact activation not only leads to thrombin generation but also upregulation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Thrombin generation may also upregulate the KKS through feedback activation of FXII via thrombin-induced FXI activation. Kallikrein induces the generation of bradykinin, which interacts with the renin-angiotensin system and induces the release of inflammatory cytokines, leading to complement activation and enhanced fibrinolysis. As outlined below, knockout or selective inhibition of components of the contact activation system inhibits both fibrin generation and systemic inflammation in animal models. Recent clinical trials suggest that inhibition of FXI attenuates thrombosis with little effect on hemostasis, although the effect of inhibiting FXI in humans with infection is unknown.
7

Likewise, in a cecal ligation and puncture model designed to mimic polymicrobial peritoneal sepsis, FXI knockout mice experienced less consumptive coagulopathy than wild-type mice.
9
Prothrombin times increased significantly in wild-type mice but remained unchanged in FXI-deficient animals. Mice that lacked FXI clearly developed a less pronounced coagulopathy and relatively attenuated inflammatory response compared with wild-type controls, and this translated directly to a significant survival advantage (46% vs 13%). This experimental model was later replicated to further define the changes in inflammatory cytokine levels and coagulation profiles in FXI knockout mice. Compared with wild-type mice, FXI-deficient mice demonstrated significantly lower plasma levels of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) during the infection. Survival at 7 days was also significantly higher in the FXI knockout mice (39% vs 6%).
10

However, pharmacologicl inhibition of FXIa or deficiency of FXI has the potential to impair hemostasis, which may already be compromised during some infections. Therefore, inhibition of other components of the contact activation complex have been evaluated. The murine monoclonal antibody 14E11, which binds to the A2 domain of FXI and selectively disrupts reciprocal activation of FXI and FXII without affecting activation of FXI by thrombin or FIX activation by FXIa, had beneficial effects in the cecal ligation and puncture model described above, including significantly improved survival (80% vs 45%). On postmortem organ evaluation, only 40% of 14E11-treated mice had evidence of hepatic vascular microthrombi as compared with 75% of the control group. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a and IL-6, were significantly lower in the 14E11-treated mice.
11
Administration of 14E11 to
L monocytogenes
-infected mice also improved survival.
8

Similarly, preclinical studies have evaluated the role of FXII in health and disease. FXII knockout mice are protected from experimentally induced thrombosis in numerous models while displaying normal hemostatic capacity.
12
Upregulated FXII activation is the cause of certain forms of hereditary angioedema and leads to excess bradykinin generation, complement activation, increased vascular permeability, and edema. The monoclonal antibody 3F7 that inhibits the activity of FXIIa has been shown to be protective against bradykinin generation and edema in mouse models of hereditary angioedema and to prevent bradykinin generation in plasma from humans with hereditary angioedema.
13
The recombinant version of the antibody, CSL312, is currently under clinical development for treatment or prevention of hereditary angioedema.
14
Finally,
Ixodes ricinus
contact phase inhibitor, a dual inhibitor of FXIa and FXIIa isolated from the saliva of
I ricinus
ticks, has been shown to be attenuate thrombosis in animal models without apparent detriment to hemostasis.
15
The effect of simultaneous inhibition of FXIa and FXIIa in humans remains unknown.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can emerge after a variety of serious insults, including trauma, blood loss, amniotic fluid or fat embolism, and severe viral or bacterial infections, and can lead to organ failure and death. Inhibition of contact activation may attenuate development of SIRS and reduce mortality. Antibody-mediated inhibition of FXIIa improved outcomes in a baboon model of lethal
Escherichia coli
challenge.
16
Rapidly developing fatal hypotension after infusion of cultured
E coli
was attenuated, with 1 in 5 (20%) survival in the group that received a FXIIa inhibitory antibody (C6B7). A later study demonstrated that baboons pretreated with C6B7 before
E coli
exposure also exhibited reduced complement activation, neutrophil degranulation, and levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and IL-6 compared with untreated controls.
17

More recent nonhuman primate work by Silasi et al
18
investigated the effects of the recombinant monoclonal anti-FXI antibody 3G3 (AB023), a humanized variant of the mouse anti-FXI antibody 14E11, discussed above, in baboons that received an intravenous lethal dose of inactivated
S aureus
. All animals given prophylactic 3G3 survived to 7 days as compared with none in the untreated control arm. Administration of 3G3 reduced the consumptive coagulopathy as reflected by shorter partial thromboplastin times and resulted in fewer respiratory complications, less tachypnea, and reduced fever as compared with untreated controls. Serum biomarkers of end-organ dysfunction were also significantly decreased. Upon postmortem analysis, no microvascular thrombi were detected in the lungs, kidneys, and livers of the 3G3-treated baboons, and organs appeared normal on histopathologic evaluation. In contrast, extensive microvascular thrombosis and organ damage were detected in untreated animals.
18

Inhibition of reciprocal FXI and FXII activation with 3G3 resulted in a marked blunting of the cytokine storm usually associated with bacteremia and sepsis. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-1b were lower in FXI-inhibited nonhuman primates. Treated animals also displayed decreased contact (prekallikrein), fibrinolytic (t-PA), and complement cascade activation, reflected by lower levels of circulating C3b and C5b-9 terminal complement complex.
18
A more recent preliminary study with 5C12, an antibody that directly inhibits FXIIa, in the same baboon model of lethal SIRS yielded results similar to those observed with 3G3.
19

5 HUMAN AND ANIMAL DATA SUGGESTING THE POTENTIAL SAFETY OF CONTACT SYSTEM INHIBITION

While the contact activation system of coagulation leads to thrombin generation and appears to contribute to the development of thrombosis, it seems to be mostly dispensable for hemostasis. Epidemiologic data suggest that individuals with congenital FXI deficiency are largely protected against venous and arterial thrombosis while usually having only a mild bleeding diathesis with little or no spontaneous bleeding, and the bleeding with hemostatic challenge (trauma, major surgery) often does not require treatment. Importantly, congenital FXII deficiency, while rare, is not associated with abnormal bleeding.
12
The relative safety of reducing FXI activity in humans was demonstrated in a prospective clinical trial of an antisense oligonucleotide that reduced plasma FXI levels in surgical patients. Partial reduction in FXI levels was an effective method for prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty and was associated with a trend for less bleeding than traditional anticoagulation.
20
Similarly, antibody-mediated inhibition of FXIa was associated with a trend for less bleeding than that observed with low-molecular-weight heparin in a large prospective trial of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty.
21
In a phase 1 trial, AB023 appeared to be safe without any notable drug-related adverse effects in healthy volunteers.
22
While recent retrospective analyses have suggested anticoagulation with heparin products may improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19,
4
selective targeting of contact activation may offer a more refined approach, with no impact on hemostasis, and would likely be associated with fewer bleeding complications. However, the safety of inhibiting the contact activation system in patients with bacterial or viral infections has not been assessed.

Innate immunity does not appear to be compromised in humans with congenital FXI or FXII deficiency, although FXI deficiency has been associated with nasal infections in Holstein cattle.
23
Epidemiologic studies of humans with FXI deficiency reported identical rates of hospitalization for pneumonia and pneumonia-related outcomes as controls with normal FXI levels. To our knowledge, there are no reports linking human FXI deficiency with an immunocompromised phenotype.
24
Thus, while contact activation appears to contribute to proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways in humans, the absence of FXI does not seem to significantly compromise host defense or hemostasis. It should be noted that results from a study of a mouse model of pneumonia conflict with this premise. Thus, Stroo and colleagues
25
,
26
showed that administering
Streptococcus pneumoniae
or
Klebsiella
into the lungs resulted in more inflammation and higher mortality in FXI-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. While raising a cautionary note, these findings may represent a species-specific effect like that observed in Holstein cattle. It is reassuring that the aforementioned epidemiologic study found no increase in the frequency of pneumonia in FXI-deficient humans compared with those with normal FXI levels. Furthermore, in those with pneumonia, there was no significant difference in severity or short-term mortality.
24
We posit that a strategy directly targeting FXII or targeting the link between FXII and FXI will not produce the same effect as complete deficiency of FXI and, importantly, leave the hemostatic function of FXI intact. However, it will be important to monitor the response when directly targeting or eliminating the function of the KKS in patients with pneumonia.

6 CONTACT SYSTEM INHIBITORS CURRENTLY IN HUMAN TRIALS

Multiple agents targeting FXI, and one targeting FXII, have been evaluated in early-phase clinical trials. Inhibitors of FXI under evaluation include IONIS-FXI Rx, a FXI antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits hepatic synthesis of FXI; MAA868 (abelacimab
)
, a monoclonal antibody that binds the catalytic domain of both FXI and FXIa; Osocimab (BAY1213790), a monoclonal antibody that only binds the catalytic domain of FXIa; BAY1831865, a monoclonal antibody that binds the A3 domain of FXI and prevents FXIa-mediated activation of FIX; and JNJ-70033093 and BAY2433334, which are small-molecule inhibitors of FXIa. More selective inhibitors of contact activation upstream of FXIa include AB023 (3G3), a monoclonal antibody that binds FXI and inhibits its activation by FXIIa and FXII activation by FXIa; and CSL312, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits FXIIa.
14
,
27

Preclinical data and rationale exist for preventing the activation of FXI and FXII while preserving some of the hemostatic FXI activity in patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, of these drugs, only AB023 (3G3) has been tested in infection models and has shown promise in preventing the systemic inflammatory response, clinical decompensation, and death in a nonhuman primate model of lethal bacterial challenge. By targeting the reciprocal activation of FXI and FXII, AB023 breaks the connection between activation of FXII by foreign surfaces that may get exposed during bacterial and viral infections, thereby downregulating activation of FXI and the KKS. Moreover, selectively inhibiting the pathologic interaction between FXII and FXI to prevent deleterious thrombin and kallikrein generation would still preserve the hemostatic function of FIX activation by thrombin-induced FXI activation. Therefore, FXI activation by FXIIa, by virtue of its position as an interface between contact activation and thrombin generation, may represent a unique target to safely prevent or treat COVID-19-related inflammatory complications including the cytokine response and the coagulopathy and to reduce associated mortality.

7 CONCLUSION

The world is in the midst of a pandemic, the time course and resolution of which is unclear. In such times it is the responsibility of the scientific and medical community to quickly develop well-designed clinical trials rationally based on preclinical and clinical data. We propose the FXII - FXI axis as a rational therapeutic target. A potential clinical trial could include prophylaxis against decompensation in COVID-19 patients with severe disease as evidenced by a reduction in the need for ventilator treatment, shorter time to ventilator weaning, or reduced progression to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hemostatic safety and potential effects on the innate immune response will need to be monitored as part of this novel approach. In addition to these clinically relevant end points, which may free up vital resources, the available preclinical data suggest that inhibition of contact activation has the potential to improve survival in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced severe COVID-19.

Abstract

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a global medical crisis that has posed immense challenges to the medical fraternity worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that targets the host's Angiotensin Converting Enzyme -2 (ACE2) receptors present in the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and intestines. Symptoms are primarily respiratory in origin but the disease has the propensity to involve all organ systems quickly to cause multi-organ failure and death. The patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases are more prone to contracting infection, and the involvement of cardiovascular system itself has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, learning about the cardiovascular implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the cardiology world at this juncture. Herein, we review the initial literature relevant to SARS-CoV-2 associated cardiovascular pathology, highlighting cardiac manifestations, biomarker utility and therapeutic landscape in the present era of COVID-19.

Background: The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 remains poorly understood by clinicians. Identifying biologic markers associated with prognosis can help clinicians recognize disease severity.
Objective: To describe the association between D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, LDH, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated on the inpatient medical service at a university hospital in Washington, DC.
Design: In this retrospective study, we included all adults admitted to the inpatient medicine service at George Washington University Hospital between March 12, 2020 and May 9, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors not requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring intubation, and non-survivors.
Key Results: 299 patients were included in our study, of whom 69 required transfer to the ICU, 39 required intubation, and 71 died. Threshold values for IL-6 (>50 pg/mL), D-dimer (>3 mcg/mL), ferritin (>450 ng/mL), CRP (>100 mg/L), and LDH (1,200 u/L) were found to be statistically significant and independently associated with higher odd of clinical deterioration and death. Hypertension, CVA and heart disease independently had an increased risk of all three outcomes, while CKD had only an increased risk of death. Patient co-morbidities had no effect on the different biomarkers' significant association with poor patient clinical outcomes, except cancer. Conclusion: Laboratory markers of inflammation and coagulopathy can help clinicians identify patients who are at high risk for clinical deterioration, independent of clinically significant medical comorbidities

During this unprecedented time of extraordinary stress on the US healthcare system, the AHA/ASA
Stroke Council--as individuals in our localities and together as an entity at the national level--
acknowledge the mounting concern regarding optimal stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic
among vascular neurologists and those clinicians who care for patients with stroke. We therefore
seek to provide guidance for the care of stroke patients in the midst of the crisis. Ordinarily,
national recommendations go through a rigorous process of development, refinement, peer review,
and thoughtful promulgation. None of that is possible at this time, yet we believe there is a
substantial need for a broad policy statement that reflects both the commonality of the pandemic
across the US and the individual variability necessary at local sites. We issue this temporary
statement as an interim stopgap opinion, pending a more thorough and considered process.
1. COVID-19 and Cerebrovascular Disease
Although 80% of patients infected with the virus remain non-hospitalized, in full form, COVID-19 is
a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus now named Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV-21. In the past few weeks it has become clear that patients
infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus may present in a number of ways, including with neurological
symptoms that are coincident with, or could potentially precede, pulmonary symptoms and fever.
To date, no comprehensive survey of neurological manifestations of coronavirus viremia has been
published, but two retrospective case series have been posted without peer review on pre-print
servers. In these descriptions of convenience samples from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, up to
36% of COVID-19 patients manifest neurological symptoms2, 3. The most common neurological
manifestations were dizziness (16.8%), headache (13.1%), and encephalopathy (2.8%). The most
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2020
common peripheral signs and symptoms were anosmia (5.1%), dysgeusia (5.6%), and muscle
injury (10.1%, detected by elevated creatine kinase). Stroke complicated COVID-19 infection in
5.9% of patients at median 10 days after symptom onset. Patients with stroke were older, had more
cardiovascular comorbidities, and more severe pneumonia. Stroke mechanisms may vary and could
include hypercoagulability from critical illness and cardioembolism from virus-related cardiac
injury4. Some of these observations reflect the known biology of the virus, as the obligate receptor
for the virus spike protein, human angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE2, is expressed in epithelial
cells throughout the body, including in the central nervous system, raising the possibility of a direct
role in viral infection5. Other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been
identified in the brains of patients (case reports) and heavily in the brains of mice that express
human ACE26, 7. However, at this time there are no peer-reviewed published reports of clinical signs
of SARS CoV-2 encephalitis or meningitis.
2. Exigencies
We seek to describe here the impact of the pandemic on the delivery of acute stroke treatment.
a. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Most immediately, stroke teams may
encounter difficulty responding to Code Strokes due to PPE shortages in the
Emergency Department (ED) and on inpatient units. In the ED, the Code Stroke
patient often arrives with limited available history and few or no family members or
witnesses. Many acute stroke patients are confused, aphasic or otherwise unable to
provide the necessary information for COVID-19 screening. Ideally, every Code
Stroke patient would be treated as potentially infected; the Code Stroke response
2
10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030023
team would don full PPE at the highest level. Such an approach is generally not
possible, however.
Stroke patients may have asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop COVID-19
after admission and treatment for stroke. Stroke patients frequently develop fevers
due to other complications of stroke, such as aspiration pneumonia and UTI, and
they will need to be evaluated quickly for COVID-19. These realities will stress the
system even further.
Stroke teams across the country have shared with us a variety of creative and novel
solutions to the PPE shortage. Prior to sharing these with the stroke community, we
feel compelled to vet them and seek permission to publish them. Over the coming
days we seek to post helpful solutions and suggestions. For example, some hospitals
have partnered with local industry to create PPE with 3D Printers or repurposing of
other technology to produce PPE items. We are aware that many teams have begun
using telemedicine both within their own ED and regionally. This solution avoids the
use of needed PPE, allows a reasonable stroke evaluation, avoids unnecessary inter-
facility transfers, and reduces exposure risk for the stroke team.
b. Hospital Personnel. Either through prophylactic quarantine or direct illness, most
stroke teams will be forced to function with fewer staff members. Neurologists and
other health care workers may be redeployed to other settings to respond to the
increasing demands of COVID-19, particularly as other colleagues become ill. In
some centers, ED staff are trained and competent to evaluate Code Strokes, and with
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2020
stroke team guidance, to administer intravenous thrombolysis or transfer patients
for possible mechanical thrombectomy. Some centers have non-stroke team staff
available to monitor patients and arrange for post rt-PA or post-thrombectomy care.
In other centers, the loss of stroke team members may create a significant gap in
care. We are aware of many stroke teams across the country expressing concern as
to whether they can or will be able to continue to function.
We believe that all stroke teams should endeavor to adhere to all published
guidelines regarding patient selection for therapy; treatment times (e.g., door-to-
needle and door-to-groin puncture); and post-recanalization monitoring. However,
we wish to inform regulatory authorities--and we wish to reassure stroke teams--
that in the setting of the pandemic full compliance has become a goal, not an
expectation. Across the wide variety of health care delivery systems in our country,
full compliance with all guidelines cannot happen at all times in every locality.
We further wish to distinguish patient selection/treatment from logistic or process
compliance. Patients who qualify for treatment will benefit, even if every single vital
sign cannot be acquired post thrombolysis, for example. Teams must use their
judgement, guided by local realities, and continue to try to treat as many acute
stroke patients as possible.
3
10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030023
c. Hospital Beds. Most, if not all, medical centers will likely fill all intensive care beds in
the setting of COVID-19. Patients with large intracerebral hemorrhages,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, or large ischemic strokes at risk for herniation must be
monitored in intensive care unit settings with appropriately trained personnel,
where possible. We are aware of situations in which NeuroICU beds may be
requested for COVID-19 patients, to the exclusion of stroke patients. Although we
recognize that hospitals and critical care administrators will need to prioritize ICU
resources during the pandemic, we want to encourage appropriate resource
allocation for critically ill stroke patients. In each locality specialists from all
intensive care specialties--e.g., pulmonary, cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery--
must discuss the relative merits of prolonged ICU care for any particular patient.
In the US, stroke patients may be observed in an ICU setting for 24 hours after
thrombolysis or thrombectomy, regardless of their status, with rigid intervals for
regular vital signs and neurological assessments. There is no evidence base
underlying this practice. In the absence of data supporting current practice, we
suggest that it is feasible to move stable stroke patients to step-down or other units
if an intensive care unit bed is needed8.
In general, patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH) have higher mortality and are more likely to undergo an
interventional or surgical procedure and require intubation and prolonged time in
an intensive care unit, compared to ischemic stroke patients. Physicians and other
health care personnel should follow the most up-to-date and evolving guidelines
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2020
regarding intubation, interventional procedures, and critical care for these patients
in setting of the pandemic. Appropriate intensive care of these seriously ill patients
with hemorrhagic stroke, some of whom are also young and with an excellent long-
term outcome, should be maintained.
Finally, to protect staff, facilitate infectious disease evaluations, and conserve PPE,
many hospitals have made the decision to admit all COVID-19 positive patients and
those patients still under evaluation, regardless of other co-incident disease, to
specialized COVID0-19 units. Many of the staff on these units will not have stroke
care training. Stroke Medical Directors and Coordinators should provide guidance
to staff unfamiliar with managing acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients.
d. Emergency Medical Services (EMS). We are aware of anecdotal reports that stroke
admission volumes have declined in some communities. This observation requires
rigorous confirmation before we can offer sensible recommendations. If true, it can
be asked whether the public anxiety around COVID-19 discourages some patients,
especially those with mild stroke and stroke-mimics, from accessing the EMS. A
testable hypothesis would be that in the face of declining total stroke volume there
would persist a constant rate of moderate/severe stroke and thrombectomies. We
therefore ask all participating stroke centers to contribute their data to the GWTG
database vigilantly as this will be the simplest way to document any decrement in
stroke volume. We also encourage stroke leaders and advocates to work with local
4
10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030023
media and public marketing to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency
care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms.
3. Provisional Guidance
We can offer very limited guidance to stroke teams in the US at this time. We do pledge to continue
to collect your individual protocols and best practices and to evaluate and post them as
appropriate. In very broad terms we recommend the following:
a. Guideline Adherence. Continue treating stroke patients as appropriate. Full
adherence to guidelines may be challenging but needed treatment should be offered
to the extent possible.
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211
b. PPE. Seek ways to minimize the use of scarce PPE in your medical center. Send
fewest possible team members to see Code Stroke patients, and into rooms for
follow up visits.
c. Telemedicine. Telemedicine began with telestroke. The NIHSS can be performed
efficiently via telemedicine9. Televideo is superior to telephone10. Yet telephonic
consultation is superior to no consult.
d. Health and Safety. Take care of yourselves, your families, and your teammates.
Follow protocol (local, CDC and WHO), including guidelines for hand washing, PPE
use, COVID-19 testing and evaluation, and self-quarantine as needed.
e. Teamwork. Stroke care has always been a multispecialty, collaborative effort
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2020
among EMS, physicians and nurses from the Emergency Departments to the Stroke
Units, ICUs and Rehabilitation Centers. Collaboration, collegiality, and compassion
for one another are crucial to making it through this challenge. A true sense of a
unified Stroke System of Care is needed now more than ever.
4. Caveat
Our recommendations and anecdotal advice are offered to the general stroke community in the
context of the gravest public health threat in our country's recent history. Nothing in this document
has been submitted to the normal guideline development and peer review, although we will begin
such a process immediately and update this statement continuously during the crisis. Please keep
checking the AHA/ASA website.

Background
The most severely COVID-19 patients need intensive care and show increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although some patients meet the diagnostic criteria for the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, the pathogenesis of the diffuse thrombotic status remains unclear.
The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera of deceased patients with autoptic proven thrombotic microangiopathy to evaluate if some patients may have developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS).
Methods
Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The available medical history, comorbidities, therapies, laboratory and autopsy findings were collected post-mortem from clinical records.
IgA, IgG and IgM anti cardiolipin (ACA) and anti b2 glycoprotein 1 (b2GP1) antibodies, IgG and IgM anti phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) antibodies were tested for all the patients.
Results
3/35 (8.6%) patients were slightly positive for aPL: one for ACA IgG and two for ACA IgM but values were low (< 3X the cut off). No patients tested positive for ACA IgA neither for b2GP1 isotypes. 3/35 (8.6%) patients were positive for PS/PT, one for IgG and two for IgM, but values were less than 2X the cut off. No patients showed simultaneous positivity for ACA and PS/ PT.
Conclusions
It is difficult to categorize the vascular events into a conventional disease: we did not find significant association with anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is most likely that several factors contribute to trigger the hypercoagulability status and the thromboembolism but, on the basis our results, CAPS is probably not involved into the pathogenesis of these phenomena.

Background: Hypercoagulability is becoming widely recognized as a major complication of COVID-19 infection as evidenced by high levels of fibrinogen degradation products and microthrombi identified within the lungs and kidneys of autopsy specimens from these patients. We report thromboelastography (TEG) testing on a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of admission to the intensive care unit.
Methods: TEG testing was performed using the TEG 6s analyzer near or at the time of ICU admission. We also report the results of other coagulation or inflammatory related indices such as platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin. All laboratory testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in the course of normal patient care and retrospectively reviewed.
Results: We found that maximum clot strength was consistently elevated in COVID-19 patients while normal in all patients found to be negative. We did not encounter significant prolongations of coagulation assays outside of those expectedly prolonged by heparin therapy nor was meeting the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered.
Conclusions: We postulate that elevated maximum clot strength by TEG testing is predictive of COVID-19 status as within our cohort this perfectly predicted patients COVID-19 status despite a high level of suspicion in negative patients with normal TEG results. While these results require a larger cohort for confirmation, we feel that TEG testing could improve confidence in negative COVID-19 testing results in suspected patients possibly allowing for earlier de-escalation of infectious precautions and personal protective equipment utilization.

Abstract

The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics. Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed. This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection. Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available. The reported structure of the target Mpro was described in this review to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using virtual high throughput screening."

Abstract

Background
COVID-19 infections have been shown to be associated with a range of thromboembolic disease.

Objective
To describe our endovascular experience in a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 who presented with large vessel occlusions, and to describe unique findings in this population.

Methods
Mechanical thrombectomy was performed on five consecutive patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusions. A retrospective study of these patients was performed. Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed.

Results
Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Clot fragmentation and distal emboli to a new vascular territory were seen in two of five (40%) patients, and downstream emboli were seen in all five (100%) patients. Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion.

Conclusion
Our series of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated coagulation abnormalities, and compared with our previous experience with mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion, this group of patients were younger, had tandem or multiple territory occlusions, a large clot burden, and a propensity for clot fragmentation. These patients present unique challenges that make successful revascularization difficult.

Background
Emergence of the novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) in December 2019 has led to the covid-19 pandemic. The extent of covid-19 involvement in the central nervous system is not well established, and the presence or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a topic of debate.

Case description
We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease.

Conclusion
Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the virus' nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.

During the past 4 months, we have witnessed unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic that by now has affected every corner of the planet, infecting more than 3.3 million people, killing more than 234,000,
[1]
,
[2]
and directly or indirectly affecting billions of individuals.
[3]
The quick rise in both cases and deaths was due to the high infectivity of the virus, quickly overwhelming health-care systems and prompting physical distancing measures of historically unprecedented scale.
[4]
The speed and robustness of public health responses within individual countries appear to be associated with early successful containment, fewer cases, and lower mortality.
[5]
,
[6]
Driven by fears just as powerful as hopes, the humanity is now firmly united in defeating the common enemy, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

As country after country fell victim to the relentless disease, disbelief gave way to horror as the ""far-away problem"" became one that hits all too close to home.
[7]
One new fact after another emerged about our new mortal enemy - from its ruthless affinity for those with comorbid conditions to the high proportion of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.
[4]
With few exceptions, there is a striking yet expected relationship between the average recorded daily deaths per million population and both the average age and the percentage of geriatric population among countries around the world
[Figure 1]
a and
[Figure 1]
b
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. There may also be a similar correlation between the number of symptomatic cases and the average population age,
[11]
suggesting strongly that SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to discriminate by national wealth, per-capita income, or number of hospital beds per person.
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
It is hoped that the costly lessons of what is believed to be only the first global wave of COVID-19 will help inform any subsequent waves of COVID-19 disease, as well as future pandemic response across both high-income countries (HICs) and low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).
[14]
,
[15]

Figure 1: Deaths per million population versus (a, top) mean age of country's population and percentage of country's population >=65 years (b, bottom)

The collective learning among geographically separated members of the international medical community is another example of the new global age of instant scientific communication and synergy creation. In this context, several group experiences helped change and refine how we treat patients. For example, the initial management approach in Europe and America was to intubate early, when the COVID-19 respiratory failure was still mild.
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
However, this approach did not seem to reduce mortality in the affluent Lombardy region of Italy, where some of the highest mortality rates in the world were recorded.
[16]
This aggressive intubation approach was contrasted to a study from China where patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as the first-line therapy, followed by a stepwise escalation to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and then tracheal intubation for refractory cases.
[19]
In the latter experience, only 4 out of 318 patients were eventually intubated.
[19]
Similar experiences and success stories have been reported with early proning of nonintubated patients.
[4]
,
[20]

Recent reports also suggest that many patients with COVID-19 present with so-called ""silent hypoxia"" that is characterized by the apparent absence of dyspnea or overt air hunger.
[21]
,
[22]
Of interest, patients with such ""silent hypoxia"" appear to be more likely to progress on to develop severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 within 2-4 days without early aggressive intervention (e.g., HFNC and nonintubated proning). Mechanistically, the damaged lungs have impaired O
2
handling, but the CO
2
exchange is still intact. Because CO
2
is the main driver for dyspnea, patients may feel falsely reassured and thus do not seek emergent medical attention. Instead, hypoxia is compensated by involuntary tachypnea for 2-4 days while the lung injury progresses, up until a cytokine storm occurs, with ensuing dyspnea, elevated CO
2
, and the rapid development of severe respiratory failure.
[21]
,
[22]
From public health perspective, this phenomenon requires early and aggressive implementation of home- or community-based pulse oximetry programs, combined with around-the-clock telemedicine services, to effectively intercept patients who may be entering the rapid deterioration phase of COVID-19.
[21]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]

To help address the impact of ""silent hypoxia"" in both LMIC and HIC settings, we recommend the following combined public/community health plus hospital based-management approach to decrease the need for invasive ventilation and overall mortality in the event of widespread community transmission:

Approximately 90% of COVID-19 patients do not require hospitalization, and it may be sufficient to isolate mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases in their homes for 14-28 days
[26]

When continuous pulse oximetry is not available, monitor those showing mild symptoms at least every 8-12 h for ""silent hypoxia"" - also see ACAIM-WACEM Joint Working Group clinical management algorithm
[22]

Public education and increased access to pulse oximetry near-patient homes will be critical to successful remediation of the ""silent hypoxia"" phenomenon

Once detected, treatment of silent hypoxia (SpO
2
<90%-93% or respiratory rate >25/min) should be started according to the following stepwise escalation protocol:
[22]
,
[27]

If SpO2 remains <88% on non-rebreathing masks, use either NIV or HFNC (depending on availability)

If SpO2 remains <88% on NIV or HFNC, consider invasive ventilation.

Keep patient in prone position alternating with sitting position for >16 h/day or as long as reasonably feasible
[4]
,
[28]

Consider restricted use of intravenous fluids and the use of corticosteroids for severe respiratory failure as per recommendations,
[17]
with appropriate medication including low molecular weight heparin and end-organ support as per prevailing recommendations.

As various hospital and intensive care therapies and management approaches take shape, so does an entire new universe of telemedicine as it comes of age. Following its inception, telehealth was viewed by some as a ""modality looking for indications.""
[29]
,
[30]
This is no longer the case, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently adopted equivalency for tele- and in-person care, voiding the need for the existence of a prior patient-physician relationship to pay claims for telemedicine visits.
[31]
This is just one way in which the COVID-19 pandemic permanently changed the health-care landscape, with true effects and the magnitude of such tectonic shift to be felt for years to come.
[25]
In addition to enabling ongoing care of patients with chronic medical conditions, the new paradigm also enables innovative approaches to cross-border specialty expertise sharing as well as continued productive employment of health-care providers who may be under quarantine orders.
[4]
,
[25]
The current pandemic is likely the beginning of a long-term trend toward sustainable, home-based care models.
[30]
,
[32]

As frontline medical personnel make important clinical discoveries and advances, so do basic and translational scientists. Despite multiple clinical studies, from retrospective reviews to prospective randomized trials, showing limited or no efficacy of one therapeutic agent after another, much hope remains as the resilient cycle of scientific discovery ploughs ahead.
[4]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
And although there is no ""magic bullet"" in sight, several important discoveries were made in the areas of antivirals (preliminary results suggesting that remdesivir may shorten the duration of illness) and vaccines.
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
The first, and somewhat surprising finding, is the association between universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) national vaccination policies and reduced morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients.
[37]
Clinical trials of BCG vaccination among health-care workers are ongoing.
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
The second, and somewhat expected finding, is the apparent efficacy of convalescent plasma in the management of severe COVID-19 infections.
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
A longer-term, sustainable derivative that builds on the theme of convalescent plasma is the identification and synthesis of highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
[35]
,
[46]
,
[47]
,
[48]
Finally, important new developments are emerging in the race to produce an effective human vaccine,
[38]
,
[49]
,
[50]
although the final product will likely not be available in the immediate future.

In addition to the development of new therapeutics and vaccines, there is a tremendous need for better understanding of the COVID-19 clinical disease. For example, we do not fully understand why the disease seems to take a largely binary course - for some, it appears to be a ""flu-like illness,"" while for others, it takes a much more acute course. The differentiation between the two ""disease paths"" seems to be occurring right around the 2
nd
week of the illness.
[51]
Still, etiologic factors responsible for this phenomenon remain unknown. In another highly controversial observation, tobacco smokers appeared to be somewhat protected from the more severe manifestations of COVID-19, but it is not clear what factors (or unrecognized biases) may be responsible for these preliminary findings and confirmatory research will be required to substantiate any associated claims.
[52]
,
[53]
The ongoing recognition of new signs and symptoms, long after the first reported case of COVID-19, exemplifies the diverse number of presentations associated with the viral illness. For example, only recently was the phenomenon of ""COVID toes"" described,
[54]
and there is a growing recognition of the association between COVID-19 and thromboembolic phenomena.
[55]
,
[56]
There is also the spirit of innovation in the face of adversity. For example, when faced with acute shortage of N95 respirator masks and face shields, citizenry around the globe began designing, testing, and making their own substitute do-it-yourself products, with various degrees of success and air filtration effectiveness.
[57]
,
[58]
,
[59]

As the global fight against the pandemic continues, we must remember and persist in the hope that this traumatic event will eventually come to an end. With this optimistic outlook, we must start thinking about the humanity's emergence from the state of ""deep freeze,"" physical distancing, and the respectful fear of the unknown. Key to this post-COVID-19 ""rebirth"" of sorts will be a well-organized, well-thought-out system of checks and balances that will allow the maintenance of appropriate safety measures while also permitting the return of economic activity in the broadest possible sense. A formidable new challenge will be the copresence of COVID-19 and influenza during the next annual ""flu season,"" effectively resulting in what the authors are coining as ""Covi-Flu season."" The costs of dual testing, personal protective equipment, as well as the need for high degree of clinical vigilance are likely to create significant inefficiencies across our clinics and emergency departments. To overcome this and many other challenges, some degree of ""collective sacrifice"" will likely be necessary, whether it means large-scale testing and issuing vaccination/immunity certificates, or perhaps a protracted period of continued social distancing with associated ramification of being ""together but separated."" Ultimately, these difficult questions will need to be answered by citizens of each region of the globe while maintaining the utmost respect for the prevailing cultural norms, individual freedoms, and the collective societal well-being. We live in special times, and we shall emerge from the great challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic together, as a one human family, stronger, wiser, and better."

KEY FINDINGS
Based on low-quality data, there is benefit from the use of anticoagulants for severe COVID-
19. This effect needs to be confirmed through randomized controlled trials.
* A proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 develop a hypercoagulable state on the 7th-14th
day of illness.(1)
* Some experts believe that anticoagulation, most commonly with LMWH, may be of benefit to
prevent disease progression and reduce mortality in COVID-19.(2,3)
* Evidence from two retrospective cohort studies show that the use of LMWH in COVID-19 is
associated with:(4,5)
o Improved surrogate markers for disease progression (increase in lymphocyte & platelet
counts and decrease in D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products, and IL-6)
o Reduced 28-day mortality in high risk patients
* There is no ongoing registered clinical trial on the use of LMWH for COVID-19.
* The dose, duration, and timing of LMWH are not well established.
* There is risk of bleeding, especially in the presence of thrombocytopenia.
* The International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis and the Philippine Society of Vascular
Medicine recommend that initiation of anticoagulation using LMWH be considered in certain
subsets of patients with COVID-19.(6,7)

RESULTS
As of April 11, 2020, there is no randomized controlled trial that answers the question posted. We
identified two retrospective cohorts that studied the association between use of anticoagulants in COVID-
19 and disease progression and/or mortality, and a retrospective cohort and a network meta-analysis that
address the issue of safety. Selection bias, lack of control of confounders, and indirectness were
methodological flaws identified. See Table 1 for the characteristics of the included studies.
The use of LMWH in patients with severe COVID-19 was associated with significant decreases in D-dimer
levels and IL-6 levels, and reduced risk of 28-day mortality among those who met the sepsis-induced
coagulopathy (SIC) criteria >4 (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.90], p=0.029 or those with D-dimer levels >6
times elevated (OR 0.44 [95% CI 0.22-0.87], p=0.017).(4,5) There seemed to be no significant difference
in bleeding complications between anticoagulants and placebo, but there was a consistent tendency
towards an increase in bleeding-related transfusions as the clinical condition becomes more severe
among patients with bacterial sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.(8,9)
CONCLUSION
Based on low-quality evidence, there seems to be benefit, seen as reduction in 28-day mortality and
improvement in inflammatory and coagulation markers, from the use of anticoagulants in severe COVID-
19. This effect needs to be confirmed through randomized controlled trials.

Abstract

Nordic countries have a long tradition of collecting health related population data meticulously and reporting them transparently. Such data provide firm grounds for making good decisions and as a result the public health institutions in Scandinavia enjoy the trust of society. The Covid-19 pandemic has, however, resulted in a completely new situation as we are now exploring in uncharted waters. Based on reports from China,

and perhaps with the good intention of reducing anxiety among this vulnerable population group, it has been widely publicized that pregnant women are not at increased risk of susceptibility, infectivity and severity of COVID-19 compared to the general population or non-pregnant women, although a systematic review of 108 cases of laboratory confirmed pregnancies with COVID-19 has reported the possibility of increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women.

Abstract

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a large surge of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prior phase I trials (non COVID-19) demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function in ARDS patients using fibrinolytic therapy. A follow-up trial using the widely available tissue-plasminogen activator (alteplase) is now needed to assess optimal dosing and safety in this critically ill patient population.

Objective

To describe the design and rationale of a Phase IIa trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alteplase treatment for moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS.

Patients/Methods

A rapidly adaptive, pragmatic, open label, randomized, controlled, phase IIa clinical trial will be conducted with three groups: intravenous(IV) alteplase 50mg, IV alteplase 100mg, and control (standard-of-care). Inclusion criteria are known/suspected COVID-19 infection with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<150mmHg for >4 hours despite maximal mechanical ventilation management. Alteplase will be delivered through an initial bolus of 50mg or 100mg followed by heparin infusion for systemic anticoagulation, with alteplase re-dosing if there is a >20% PaO2/FiO2 improvement not sustained by 24 hours.

Results

The primary outcome is improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours post-randomization. Other outcomes include: ventilator- and ICU-free-days, successful extubation (no reintubation <=3 days after initial extubation), and mortality. Fifity eligible patients will be enrolled in a rapidly adaptive, modified stepped-wedge design with four looks at the data.

Conclusion

Findings will provide timely information on the safety, efficacy and optimal dosing of tPA to treat moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS, which can be rapidly adapted to a phase III trial. (NCT04357730; FDA IND 149634)

Physiologic, metabolic, and vascular changes in normal and high-risk pregnancies may affect risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection and modify/exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19.

*

Pregnant women may be at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with more severe COVID-19 symptoms, and worse pregnancy outcomes.

*

Studies to date have demonstrated higher risks of pregnancy complications, including preterm birth and preeclampsia, as well as higher rates of cesarean delivery.

*

Pharmacological therapy is limited to medications with proven safety during pregnancy and lactation; safety data are often unavailable for medications in early stages of clinical trials.

*

The current recommendations are based on a limited number of studies. Future, large, likely multi-center, studies will be critical in improving our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and pregnancy, which may optimize COVID-19 preventive and treatment strategies during normal and high risk pregnancies.

Abstract

The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with worse outcomes in several patient populations, including the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities. Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiological changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes of high-risk pregnancies may affect pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of Angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to Angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at an elevated risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering Angiotensin 1-7 levels, which can mimic/worsen vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during both pregnancy and breast feeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials. We summarize guidelines for medical/obstetric care and outline future directions for optimization of treatment and preventive strategies for pregnant patients with COVID-19 with the understanding that relevant data are limited and rapidly changing."

] There is increasing recognition that the COVID-19-associated hemostasis abnormality (CAHA) may instead be resulting in localized thrombosis in the lungs, which has been reinforced by the fact that timely anticoagulation can be successful in reducing mortality of seriously unwell patients.[
4
]
[
5
] This has led to recommendations for early intensive anticoagulation, in the absence of absolute contraindications, for all COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.[
6
] Very recent postmortem reports have in fact confirmed this hypercoagulable state, with evidence of pulmonary thrombi, mostly microvascular, in all the four decedents evaluated.[
7
] Recognizing the basis of the predominant lung pathology linked with the rapid clinical deterioration that is often unresponsive to ventilatory assistance and supportive care is critical to devising the interventions aimed at reducing mortality in these patients.

Immunothrombosis and Pulmonary Microthrombi

The hemostasis and immune systems have always been linked to one other. In evolutionary biology, it was recognized that both these systems shared the same purpose.[
8
] It may be considered that a blood clot formed at the site of wound limits the loss of the most important constituent, the blood. But also, equally importantly, it stops any microorganisms invading the circulation through the breached vessel wall. Various components of the hemostatic system contribute to this immune function. Thrombin is the key player which plays a central role in linking the clotting pathways to the innate immune system.[
9
] In addition, crosstalk between the various other coagulation factors, including the kallikrein-kininogen pathways on one side and cytokines, complement system, and the innate immune system on the other, is also well established.[
10
]
[
11
] The main cellular component of the hemostatic system, the platelet, also plays a key role in this area. Several of its granular constituents are microbicidal and chemotactic; both functions may play a more important role than hemostasis in the setting of infections.[
12
] The concept of a localized coagulation system in the lung as part of host defense or ""bronchoalveolar hemostasis"" is not recent.[
13
] Indeed, the presence of a localized hemostatic system has been recognized for many years and attempts to modulate this in pathological conditions have been tried for at least a decade.[
14
]
[
15
]
[
16
] These measures have not always been successful and localized pulmonary microthrombi continue to cause mortality in severely ill patients.[
17
]

What then is the pathophysiology of pulmonary microthrombi in patients with COVID-19? Is it the intense inflammation related to the viral invasion of the lungs which triggers hemostasis activation? The growing evidence strongly suggests that some of the clinical features of COVID-19 infection (like hypoxemia) are driven by a localized thrombotic phenomenon where both platelets and endothelium come together to initiate thrombosis. Endothelial cells constitute almost a third of the cells in the alveolar component of the lungs and have the key receptors for the SARS-CoV-2 including the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors.[
18
]
[
19
] In addition to this well-described receptor, several others, including transmembrane serine protease 2 and sialic acid receptors, are shared by both the SARS-CoV-2 and the endothelial cells.[
20
]
[
21
]
[
22
] Formation of thrombi in the microvasculature could thus be a part of the physiological effort to limit the viral invasion. Marked endothelial activation secondary to the inflammation could release a large amount of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which could then swamp the VWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS-13, leading to platelet aggregates that could also contribute to microthrombi.[
23
] Although this feature is characterized in the well-known systemic microangiopathic hemolytic disorders, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, in COVID-19, this process is limited to the lungs, and systemic evidence of microangiopathy may not be evident in all cases. Limited thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) can present as pulmonary hypertension, as reported in patients with TMA secondary to Cobalamin C deficiency and pediatric stem-cell transplantation.[
24
]
[
25
] Similar organ-limited TMA is very familiar to renal pathologists.

Pulmonary Microthrombi versus Pulmonary Emboli

It is important to distinguish pulmonary microthrombi from pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 patients. Clinically, there are several situations where thrombi in the lungs could be overlooked in patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms to hospital:

Inability to perform imaging due to work overload on the radiology department or the need for social distancing.

Absence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the limbs does not imply absence of pulmonary thrombi.[
26
]

It is well known that over half of the patients otherwise identified to have pulmonary embolism in the pre-COVID-19 era also have evidence of DVT in the lower limbs.[
27
] For this reason, in patients in whom computed tomography imaging may be less desirable (e.g., pregnancy or severe renal impairment), some clinicians (not widespread practice) perform ultrasound Doppler of the lower limbs to check for thrombi and treat with therapeutic anticoagulation, if identified.[
28
] However, this is not the case in patients with COVID-19, where DVT is not found in most patients, and pulmonary microthrombi are the result of local hypercoagulability, and not secondary to embolization from the lower limbs. For this reason, ultrasound surveillance may not be enough to identify such microthrombi. Patients who require critical care input, however, could subsequently develop venous thrombosis, which can then embolize to the lungs, further aggravating the lung dysfunction. Despite a critically ill patient being at a very high risk of thrombosis due to various reasons (including immobilization, underlying risk factors, muscle paralysis from sedation, and the use of vasoactive drugs), the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can still be missed.[
29
] This is not helped by the fact that prophylactic anticoagulation has high failure rate in critically ill individuals, but could be even worse in the extremely activated clotting system as seen in COVID-19.[
5
]
[
30
]

Does It Matter Whether It Is Pulmonary Microthrombi or Pulmonary Emboli?

A recent publication looked at the structure and composition of thrombi and emboli using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy.[
31
] The pulmonary emboli mirrored the most distal part of venous thrombi from which they originated. Also, the proportion of red cells in venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli was much higher than in arterial thrombi and more fibrin bundles were observed in the latter compared with the former.[
31
] This finding is not clinically useful yet, but if we consider that platelets play a major role in pulmonary microthrombi compared with pulmonary emboli, it may be necessary to treat these patients with antiplatelet agents in addition to anticoagulants (the latter has proven track record only in those with pulmonary emboli). These antiplatelet drugs block platelet activation and may include conventional antiplatelet agents like aspirin or clopidogrel or intravenous forms like prostacyclin. Perhaps anti-inflammatory and anticomplement therapies are the answer to addressing the pathophysiology of pulmonary microthrombi in COVID-19, as the trigger for the microangiopathy is the inflammatory component. Very interestingly, immunocompromised individuals have been suggested to have had less pulmonary complications when infected with COVID-19.[
32
] Also, may there be a role for nebulized or localized antithrombotic therapies, which can impact microvascular hemostasis as the coagulation system is activated and largely limited to the lungs at the alveolar level.

Current Antithrombotic Strategies for Pulmonary Microthrombi

There is consensus now that all patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 receive prophylactic anticoagulation.[
6
]
[
33
] It is also certain that those who have a confirmed pulmonary emboli receive therapeutic anticoagulation. Several trials have been established, looking at randomizing patients to receive prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation based on various clinical and laboratory markers, and results are eagerly awaited. Still several interesting questions remain:

Should low-dose anticoagulants be considered for patients who may have a prothrombotic tendency and are currently in self-isolation but do not have severe symptoms of COVID-19?

Are patients who are already on anticoagulants for previous thromboembolic episodes, mechanical heart valves, or atrial fibrillation protected from severe disease and complications if they indeed get infected with the SARS-2 corona virus?

Will patients with underlying severe bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or Glanzmann thrombasthenia have less severe lung complications?

Since there is a crucial link between inflammation and thrombosis, more so in COVID-19 patients, are patients who are on immunosuppressants less likely to get severe pulmonary disease and complications?

Is there a role for antiplatelet agents in patients who progress to more severe disease while on therapeutic anticoagulation, since activated platelets are pathogenic in the lung inflammation?

Where and how should anticomplement and anti-inflammatory therapies be used in patients with COVID-19, with the intention of dampening the coagulation response?

Should patients who have recovered from severe COVID-19 after being in critical care units be considered for long-term anticoagulation with low-dose anticoagulants, like those patients who had massive pulmonary embolism in the pre-pandemic era?

Conclusion

In summary, it is important to recognize that COVID-19-associated hemostasis abnormalities, which we would term as ""CAHA,"" represent a localized thrombotic phenomenon, which thus requires specific assessment and an appropriate therapeutic response (see [
Fig. 1
]). Health care providers need to be cognizant of the significant possibility of pulmonary microthrombi in these patients and should keep a low threshold for investigating this complication in all patients. This is important because pulmonary thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may need different treatments. In the case of pulmonary microthrombi, this may be a combination of treatments in addition to anticoagulants. We are sure to win in this battle against an unseen but now well-known virus but should aim to learn a large amount quickly, regarding both its pathology and the potential therapies to limit short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in infected patients.

Fig. 1
COVID-19-associated hemostasis abnormality (CAHA) depicted in the lungs. In the undamaged lung (nonsevere COVID-19), the viral infection causes an intense inflammatory reaction. This inflammation can trigger activation of coagulation, which is an attempt to fight and block the viral invasion. In the damaged lung (severe COVID-19), unabated inflammatory reaction causes endothelial dysfunction leading to pulmonary microthrombi. Attempts to break down the extensive microthrombi are detected systemically as high D-dimer levels. ECs, endothelial cells; VWF, von Willebrand factor.

Background

An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and triggered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help.

Methods

The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Male, aged over 65, smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical manifestation such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea and laboratory examination such as WBC, AST, Cr, PCT, LDH, hs-cTnI and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19."

54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were
laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical
diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46
years (SD 9.74). The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A
44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations
of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91
[90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils,
PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were
abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial
damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral
drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and
44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%)
used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used
non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used
invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were
treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was
3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days
(IQR2.00-8.00).
Conclusions Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and
multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ
except the lungs. Secondary infection in the later period is worthy of attention.

1. INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by coronavirus occurred in
Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly worldwide[1-5]. The illness progress of partial patient is
rapid and the mortality rate is 3.4%. By 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of
infections wordwild was 95,333, of which 3,282 died[5]. In 30th January, 2020, the World

Health Organization issued a global warning about the highly contagious virus[6], which
was named as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 11th February[7]. Current
studies[8-10] demonstrate the laboratory and clinical features that COVID-19 often occurs
in elderly men with basic diseases. In early stage, fever and dry cough with reduced
lymphocytes are the major symptoms, which develop into fatal respiratory distress
syndrome and multiple organ failure in the late stage.
However, there are few studies on the clinical characteristics of death cases due to
the small sample size. To understand the clinical characteristics, a retrospective analysis
of clinical features in 101 death cases in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is carried out.
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Population
This study collected Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16,
2020 in Intensive care unit(ICU) of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
is an infectious disease hospital, which is prescribed by Chinese government as one of the
first designated treatment units for patients with the disease. The diagnosis of confirmed
cases and clinical cases is in line with Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus
Pneumonia (trial version 5)[11]. The confirmed cases are those who have pathogenic
evidence, positive RT-PCR or highly homologous gene sequencing with known
coronavirus. The clinical cases are those who have epidemic history, or who have no
definite epidemic history but have clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics.
Epidemic history includes that within 14 days somebody has travelling history in Wuhan

and surrounding areas, been exposed to other infections, communicated with patients
with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from
case-reporting communities, or clustering onset. The clinical symptoms include fever or
respiratory symptoms, and decreased lymphocyte with normal or decrease leukocyte in
the early stage.
This study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
Approval, and all relevant personnel exempt from informed consent due to the
particularity of the disease outbreak.
2.2. Data Collection
The retrospective analysis is based on the case reports, nursing records, test results,
and imaging results. Data include demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results,
possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and
48 h before death. The therapy strategy represents antiviral treatment, antibacterial
treatment, corticosteroid treatment, immunotherapy, and respiratory therapy. The onset
time is defined as the day symptom appears. Records begins from onset to admission,
admission to ICU, ICU periods, and onset to death.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
We compared the differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures
between patients who had died due to infection by COVID-19 at onset to admission,
admission to ICU and 48h before death.We present continuous measurements as mean
(SD) if they are normally distributed or median (IQR) if they are not, and categorical

variables were described as frequency rates and percentages(%). For laboratory results,
we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the normal range. We used
SPSS (version 24.0) for all analyses.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Demographics
By Feb 16, 2020, this study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care
unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, of which 57 (56.44%) patients were laboratory
confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) patients were consistent with clinical diagnostic
criteria. In the death cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical
condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition. All cases
died in the end. Among them, 1 patients died with the symptom of acute coronary artery,
while the rest of them died with the symptom of respiratory failure and multiple organ
failure caused by COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females with the age
range of 24-83 and average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had basic diseases
with hypertension 42.57%, diabetes 22.77%, neurological disease 9.90%, malignant
tumor 4.95%, and respiratory disease 4.95%. Cases combined with more than two basic
diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history with South China
Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type

( IQR8.00-13.50 ) . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days
(IQR17.00-27.5)(Table 1) .
3.2. Clinical Features
The relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are
shown in Table 2. The most common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),
but most patients dropped to normal temperature after admission 1-3 days, which may be
related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also
common symptoms. 31(30.69%) patients had sputum symptoms in the early stage with
white sputum, and 3 patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. 50(49.50%) patients
showed Acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) at the time of admission, and the
median time from onset to ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00).Other common symptoms
included myalgia, general weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among
which 86(85.15%) patients had more than two symptoms.21(20.79%) patients had no
respiratory symptoms, and 7(6.93%) patients initially appeared gastrointestinal symptoms
such as nausea and vomiting. Distinctive from SARS, only 2 patients with COVID-19
had diarrhea.
3.3. Radiographic Findings
Most of patients (99 [98.02%] of 101 patients) had abnormal lung imaging at the
time of initial admission, 6(5.94%) patients had single-lung disease, and 93(92.08%)
patients had double-lung disease. The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like
ground glass in the lung. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy

shadows in both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%)
patients.
3.4. Laboratory Findings
Blood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases when their entrance
into admission, ICU and 48h before death were collected. Most patients showed
increased leukocytes,neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes at time of
consultation.Their inflammatory indicators such as neutrophils,
Procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP), and Interleukin-6(IL-6) gradually increased
as time went on. It was found that patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and
Prothrombin time(PT) increased correspondingly during disease progression via dynamic
analysis of coagulation-related indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most
patients at admission(83 [82.18%] of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease,
myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. It also indicated that there
was a high proportion of myocardial damage in the early stage. This study also found that
liver and kidney damage were not significant at the time of admission and when
transferred to ICU, and it significantly turned worse 48h before death. Experiment data
can be seen in Table 3-5.
3.5. Treatment
For all patients, 97 patients were transferred to Jinyintan Hospital due to laboratory
diagnosis or exacerbation after treatment in other hospitals. All patients were treated in
isolation. Among them, 61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs, including Oseltamivir, Ribavirin,

Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ganciclovir, Interferon, etc. 59(58.42%) patients used
glucocorticoids, 64(63.37%) patients used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 45(44.55%)
patients used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, including
cephalosporins and quinolones, etc.,More than half of patients used restricted
antibiotics(63 [62.38%] of 101 patients), including carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline,
etc., due to repeated rise in body temperature or wave in inflammation indicators.
23(22.78%) patients used antifungal drugs.
All patients received oxygen therapy. 84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or
high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 77(76.24%) used invasive mechanical
ventilation. The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00
days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before death. The
duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1-31 days (median 5 days
[IQR2.00-8.00]). 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with
CRRT.
4. DISCUSSION
Our study reported the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths from COVID-19. As far
as we know, this is the largest sample among the research reports on the clinical
characteristics of dead patients. Although previous studies included some deaths, the
number of cases were less.
Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected people wordwild was
95,333, and the number of death was 3,282. The mortality rate was as high as 3.4%,

which is much higher than that of general pneumonia. Among the 101 deaths, male is
significantly higher than female, and the proportion of elderly patients with basic diseases
is relatively high. The average age of death patients in this study was significantly higher
than previous studies. In the study, we found the blood group composition of death
patients (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) was different from that of Han
population in Wuhan[12]. Type O was relatively low, and Type A was relatively high. The
mechanism which caused this is still unclear. ABO blood group antigen substances are
widely distributed in the human respiratory system, digestive tract system, and
reproductive system[13]. Previous research has shown that ABO blood group are related to
the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood group antigens may participate
in virus infection as receptor[14-15]. In the study of various susceptible genes in
SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O have a lower infection rate[16]. Guillon et al.
found that A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting interaction between the virus
and ACE2 receptor[17]. However, the higher proportion of patients with type A blood is
temporarily unclear and the reason may be the lack of antibody A protection. Further
research is need to explore the specific mechanism.
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with
previous studies[10], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had
fever and 10(9.90%) cases of patients were not detected fever in the onset. Moreover,
21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms when they the disease started,
and symptoms such as fever and chest tightness gradually occurred as the disease
progressed. Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early

recognition probably.
The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not
clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury,
inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections.
We collected Laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of
transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before death and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had an
elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to hospital, and it gradually increased as
disease progressed and was as high as 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h before death,
which is significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[9],Considering that these
patients have severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had
abnormal coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased
D-D and a sudden deterioration,we need to be vigilant about the presence of pulmonary
thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep vein thrombosis. For
hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable anticoagulant therapy is a
possible strategy.
It has been reported that the 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage
function of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, etc., but there was no relevant
description of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected
indicators of organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that

Most of patients had myocardial damage of which 32 patients were only complicated
with myocardial damage.2019-nCov and 2003-SARS both belong to the b coronavirus
genus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common

pathogenic target[19]. 31% of ICU patients were detected significant abnormalities in
Troponin I(TNI) in Huang's research[8]. This study found that TNI was significantly
higher in the ICU or before death , compared with when they were admitted to hospital.
Further analysis revealed that patients who enter hospital with elevated troponin survive a
faster progress from paroxysm to ICU and a shorter overall duration. The duration will be
even shorter if increase in TNI accompanied. The above results suggest that heart is a
potential target for 2019-nCOV and it impacts the disease process, so we need to monitor
and evaluate heart damage early while focusing on lung injury.
We found that as the disease progressed, patients' leukocytes, neutrophils, PCT, CRP,
etc. gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased again after the decline, and some
patients experienced a drop in body temperature and then increased or continued
temperature fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the characteristics of viral
infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have bacterial infections.
The sputum culture results also proved that some patients had bacterial and fungal
infections, among which Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida
albicans were most common bacteria. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections in
patients may be related to low immune function, severe lack of medical resources and
unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition, we need to be aware that clinical manifestations
of bacterial or fungal infections for critically ill patients may be not typical because their
immune function is extremely low and most of them are in hormone therapy. However,
the disease progress is rapid and can exacerbate in a short period of time leading to death.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to changes in patient temperature,

laboratory indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics. Prevention
and control of nosocomial infections also need to be strengthened.
In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is
still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients used antiviral drugs, 58.42% patients
used glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All patients received
antibiotic treatment including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients
used restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations in body temperature or inflammation
indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill
patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive mechanical ventilation
was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did not benefit significantly
from invasive mechanical ventilation. Most patients had suffered multiple organ failure
caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, for critical
patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in consideration.
This study has some limitations. Only the critically death patients include in the
group, and there is no comparison between the improvement groups. The sample size can
be increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group
composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group
difference is related to the susceptibility and mortality needs further study.
5. CONCLUSION
Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ
failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs.

Summary
Background In December 2019, viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by the novel
coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly worldwide, the illness
progress of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in partial patients is rapid and the
mortality rate is relatively high. The present study aims to describe the clinical features in
the death cases with COVID-19.
Methods In this single center and observational study, we recruited 101 death cases with
COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Wuhan
Jinyintan Hospital. Demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT images, possible
therapy strategies and test results were collected and analyzed on patients admission to
the ICU and 48 hours before deaths .
Findings Of 101 COVID-19 dead cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of

critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.
Over fifty six percent (56.4%) of patients were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and
43.6% were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.Among them, 64 were males and
37 were females, with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). Interestingly, all deaths
shwed significant difference in blood type distribution, with 44.44% of type A , 29.29%
of type B , 8.08% of type AB, and 18.19% of type O.The clinical manifestations of the
novel coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptoms included fever
(91,,90.10%), cough (69,68.32%) and dyspnea (75,74.26%). Neutrophils,
procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),and interleukin-6(IL-6), D-dimer gradually
increased with progress of the disease. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most
patients at admission, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. Sixty
one (60.40%) patients were given antiviral drugs, 59(58.42%),received glucocorticoids,
63.37% were given intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% were treated with
thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) were given
restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) were administrated to antifungal drugs. Non-invasive
ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy were given in 84(83.17%) patients , and invasive
mechanical ventilation was used in 76.24% patients . The median time from acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00
days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days
(IQR2.00-8.00).

1. INTRODUCTION
Viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, and spread rapidly worldwide[1-5]. The illness progress of partial
patients wasrapid and the mortality was found to be 3.4%. By 5th March, 2020, the
cumulative number of infections worldwide reached 95,333 cases, of which 3,282 died[5].
In 30th January, 2020, the World Health Organization issued a global warning about the
highly contagious virus[6], which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
11th February[7]. Current studies[8-10] demonstrated that COVID-19 often occured in
elderly men with underlying diseases based on the laboratory and clinical features. In

early stage, fever and dry cough with reduced number of lymphocytes were the major
manifestations, fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure were
advanced in the late stage.
However, there have been few studies on the clinical characteristics of death cases
due to the small sample size. To understand the clinical characteristics, a retrospective
analysis of clinical features in 101 death cases in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital was carried
out.
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Population
This study collected death cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020
in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The Hospital specialize for infectious diseases,
prescribed by Chinese government as one of the first designated treatment units for
patients with the disease. The diagnosis of confirmed and clinical cases was made
following Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 5)[11].
The confirmed cases were those who had pathogenic evidence, positive RT-PCR or
highly homologous gene sequencing with known coronavirus. The clinical cases were
those who had epidemic history, or clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics.
Epidemic history means that the suspected cases has travelling history in Wuhan and
surrounding areas within 14 days, or exposed to other infections, communicated with
patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from
case-reporting communities, or clustering onset. The clinical features include fever or

respiratory symptoms, and decreased lymphocyte or leukocyte count in the early stage.
This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
(KY-2020-28.01), and all relevant personnel exempts from informed consent due to the
particularity of the disease outbreak.
2.2. Data Collection
The retrospective analysis was based on the case reports, nursing records, test results,
and imaging results. Data include demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT results,
possible therapy strategies and test results of patients on admission to ICU or 48 h before
deaths. The therapy strategy represents antiviral and antibacterial treatments,
corticosteroid treatment, immunotherapy, and respiratory therapy. The onset time was
defined as the day symptom appeared. Records began from onset to admission, admission
to ICU, ICU periods, and onset to deaths.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
We compared the differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures
among patients died of COVID-19 at onset to admission, admission to ICU and 48h
before deaths.We present continuous measurements as mean (SD) if they were normally
distributed or median (IQR) if not, and categorical variables were described as frequency
rates and percentages(%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the
measurements were outside the normal range. SPSS (version 24.0) was used for all
analyses.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Demographics
By Feb 16, 2020, 101 cases died of COVID-19 in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital, among them 57 (56.44%) patients were confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%)
were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria. In the death cases, 47 went directly to the
ICU because of critical condition, and 54 were transferred to ICU with aggravated
condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patient died of acute coronary
syndrome, while the rest died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by
COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females, with the age range of 24-83 and
average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had underlying diseases with
hypertension(42.57%), diabetes (22.77%), neurological disease (9.90%), malignant tumor
(4.95%), and respiratory disease( 4.95%). The cases with more than two underlying
diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history in South China
Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type
distribution was significantly different, with type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB
(8.08%) and type O (18.19%). The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days
( IQR8.00-13.50 ) . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days
( IQR17.00-27.5)(Table 1) .
3.2. Clinical Features
The relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are

shown in Table 2. The most common symptom was fever (91,90.10% of 101 patients),
but most patients presented normal temperature after 1-3 days of admission , which may
be related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also
common. Additionally, 31(30.69%) patients had white sputum in the early stage , and 3
patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. Fifty(49.50%) patients showed acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) on admission, and the median time from onset to
ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00). Other common symptoms included myalgia, general
weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among them 86(85.15%) had more
than two symptoms. Twenty one (20.79%) patients had no respiratory symptoms, and
7(6.93%) showed nausea and vomiting. Distinctive from Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), only 2 patients with COVID-19 had diarrhea.
3.3. Radiographic Findings
Most of patients (99 [98.02%] of 101 patients) had abnormal lung imaging at the
time of initial admission, 6(5.94%) patients had single-lung and 93(92.08%) had
double-lung abnormalities. The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like ground
glass in the lungs. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy shadows in
both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%) patients.
3.4. Laboratory Findings
Blood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases during admission to
ICU and 48h before deaths were collected. Most patients showed increased numbers of
leukocytes and neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes count at time of consultation.The

inflammatory indicators such as neutrophils, procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),
and interleukin-6(IL-6) gradually increased as time went on. It was found that the count
of patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased
correspondingly during disease progression by dynamic analysis of coagulation-related
indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%]
of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were
significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial
damage in the early stage. We also found that liver and kidney damages were not
significant at the time of admission and when transferred to ICU, and it significantly
turned to be worse 48h before deaths. Experiment data can be seen in Table 3-5 and
Figure1.
3.5. Treatments
Ninety seven patients were transferred to the hospital based on laboratory diagnosis
or deterioration after treatments in other hospitals. All patients were treated in isolated
wards. Among them, 61(60.40%) received antiviral drugs, including Oseltamivir,
Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ganciclovir, or Interferon, etc. Glucocorticoids,
intravenous immunoglobulins, and thymosin preparations were used in, 59(58.42%),
64(63.37%) , and 45(44.55%) patients, respectively.. All patients received antibiotic
treatment, including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients received
restricted antibiotics(63,62.38%), including carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline, etc., due
to repeated fever or fluctuation of inflammation indicators. 23(22.78%) patients received
antifungal drugs.

All patients received oxygen therapy. 84(83.17%) patients were treated with
non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy, and 77(76.24%), invasive
mechanical ventilation. The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation
was 3.00 days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before deaths.
The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1-31 days (median 5 days
[IQR2.00-8.00]). Seven patients were treated with Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation(ECMO) and eight with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy(CRRT).
4. DISCUSSION
The present analyses revealed the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths caused by
COVID-19 in China. Based on our knowledge, this is the largest sample among the
reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients although some studies described a
limited number of deaths.
Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected victims was 95,333, and
the number of deaths reached 3,282 in many countries of the world. The mortality was up
to 3.4%, which is significantly high compared with that of common pneumonia. Among
the 101 deaths, males dominated and the proportion of elderly patients with underlying
diseases was relatively high. Importantly, we found that the blood group distribution of
the deaths (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) remarkably differred from that
of Han population in Wuhan[12]. Type O was relatively low but Type A was relatively high.
ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory ,

blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood
group antigens may involve in virus infection as receptor[14-15]. In the study of various
susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O had a lower infection
rate[16]. Guillon et al. found that type A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting
interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor[17]. However, the higher proportion of
patients with type A blood remains unclear although the lack of antibody A protection
might be involved. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which the
patients of type A is more susceptibe to COVID-19 infection.
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with
previous studies[10], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had
fever, for instance, no fever was noted in 10(9.90%) patients on the onset of disease.
Moreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms in the begining of the
disease, and fever and chest tightness gradually occurred with the disease progressed.
Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early identification
of COVID-19 .
The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not
clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury,
inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections.
We collected laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of
transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before deaths, and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had
an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to the hospital, and it gradually
increased with the disease progressed and was up to 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h

before deaths, significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[9],indicating a
severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had abnormal
coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased D-dimer and
a sudden deterioration. Under this circumstance, attention should be paid to the
presence of pulmonary thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep
vein thrombosis. For hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable
anticoagulant therapy is a possible choice.
It has been reported that 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage function
of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, or liver, etc., but no relevant description was
seen of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected indicators of
organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that most of patients
had myocardial damage,among them 32 patients were exclusively complicated with
myocardial damage. Both 2019-nCov and 2003-SARS belong to the genus b coronavirus ,
and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common
pathogenic receptor[19]. Thirty one percent of ICU patients were found to have significant
abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) [8]. We noted that TNI was significantly elevated in the
ICU patients or before deaths compared with primary admission to hospital. Further
analysis revealed that patients who were hospitalized with elevated troponin underwent a
fast progress from onset to ICU and to death. The results suggest that heart is a potential
targeted organ by 2019-nCOV in the disease process. Thus monitoring and prediction
of heart injury would be needed at early stage as well as in the course of disease.
Additionally, we found that with the disease progressed, counts of leukocytes,

neutrophils, PCT and CRP level gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased
again after the decline, and some patients experienced a drop of body temperature and
then increased or continued fever fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the
characteristics of viral infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have
hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially bacterial infections. The sputum culture results
also indicated bacterial and fungal infections, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans in some patients. Secondary bacterial and
fungal infections may be related to suppressed immunity, lack of medical resources and
unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition, clinical manifestations of bacterial or fungal
infections in critical patients may be unconspicuous due to their compromised immunity
or hormone therapy. Therefore, it is essential to keep monitoring temperature, laboratory
indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics of the patients.
Prevention and control of nosocomial infections also needed .
In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is
still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients received antiviral drugs, 58.42%
patients were given glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All
patients received antibiotic treatments including cephalosporins and quinolones. More
than half of patients received restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations of body
temperature or inflammation indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive
treatment for critically ill patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive
mechanical ventilation was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did
not benefit significantly from invasive mechanical ventilation and had suffered multiple

organ failure caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore,
for critical patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in
consideration.
This study has some limitations. Only the critical death patients are included, and
no comparison was made between the improvement groups. The sample size can be
increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group
composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group
difference is related to the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection needs to be clarified.
5. CONCLUSION
Critical COVID-19 may cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple
organ failure with high mortality rate.The blood group distribution of the deaths
remarkably differred from that of Han population in Wuhan.Heart may be the earliest
damaged organ except the lungs. Hospital-acquired pneumonia in the later period is
worthy of attention.

Summary
Background In December 2019, viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by the novel
coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly worldwide, the illness
progress of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in partial patients is rapid and the
mortality rate is relatively high. The present study aims to describe the clinical features in
the death cases with COVID-19.
Methods In this single center and observational study, we recruited 101 death cases with
COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Wuhan
Jinyintan Hospital. Demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT images, possible
therapy strategies and test results were collected and analyzed on patients admission to
the ICU and 48 hours before deaths .
Findings Of 101 COVID-19 dead cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of

Over fifty six percent (56.4%) of patients were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and
43.6% were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.Among them, 64 were males and
37 were females, with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). Interestingly, all deaths
shwed significant difference in blood type distribution, with 44.44% of type A , 29.29%
of type B , 8.08% of type AB, and 18.19% of type O.The clinical manifestations of the
novel coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptoms included fever
(91,,90.10%), cough (69,68.32%) and dyspnea (75,74.26%). Neutrophils,
procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),and interleukin-6(IL-6), D-dimer gradually
increased with progress of the disease. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most
patients at admission, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. Sixty
one (60.40%) patients were given antiviral drugs, 59(58.42%),received glucocorticoids,
63.37% were given intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% were treated with
thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) were given
restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) were administrated to antifungal drugs. Non-invasive
ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy were given in 84(83.17%) patients , and invasive
mechanical ventilation was used in 76.24% patients . The median time from acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00
days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days
(IQR2.00-8.00).

1. INTRODUCTION
Viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, and spread rapidly worldwide[1-5]. The illness progress of partial
patients wasrapid and the mortality was found to be 3.4%. By 5th March, 2020, the
cumulative number of infections worldwide reached 95,333 cases, of which 3,282 died[5].
In 30th January, 2020, the World Health Organization issued a global warning about the
highly contagious virus[6], which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
11th February[7]. Current studies[8-10] demonstrated that COVID-19 often occured in
elderly men with underlying diseases based on the laboratory and clinical features. In

early stage, fever and dry cough with reduced number of lymphocytes were the major
manifestations, fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure were
advanced in the late stage.
However, there have been few studies on the clinical characteristics of death cases
due to the small sample size. To understand the clinical characteristics, a retrospective
analysis of clinical features in 101 death cases in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital was carried
out.
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Population
This study collected death cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020
in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The Hospital specialize for infectious diseases,
prescribed by Chinese government as one of the first designated treatment units for
patients with the disease. The diagnosis of confirmed and clinical cases was made
following Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 5)[11].
The confirmed cases were those who had pathogenic evidence, positive RT-PCR or
highly homologous gene sequencing with known coronavirus. The clinical cases were
those who had epidemic history, or clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics.
Epidemic history means that the suspected cases has travelling history in Wuhan and
surrounding areas within 14 days, or exposed to other infections, communicated with
patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from
case-reporting communities, or clustering onset. The clinical features include fever or

respiratory symptoms, and decreased lymphocyte or leukocyte count in the early stage.
This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
(KY-2020-28.01), and all relevant personnel exempts from informed consent due to the
particularity of the disease outbreak.
2.2. Data Collection
The retrospective analysis was based on the case reports, nursing records, test results,
and imaging results. Data include demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT results,
possible therapy strategies and test results of patients on admission to ICU or 48 h before
deaths. The therapy strategy represents antiviral and antibacterial treatments,
corticosteroid treatment, immunotherapy, and respiratory therapy. The onset time was
defined as the day symptom appeared. Records began from onset to admission, admission
to ICU, ICU periods, and onset to deaths.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
We compared the differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures
among patients died of COVID-19 at onset to admission, admission to ICU and 48h
before deaths.We present continuous measurements as mean (SD) if they were normally
distributed or median (IQR) if not, and categorical variables were described as frequency
rates and percentages(%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the
measurements were outside the normal range. SPSS (version 24.0) was used for all
analyses.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Demographics
By Feb 16, 2020, 101 cases died of COVID-19 in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital, among them 57 (56.44%) patients were confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%)
were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria. In the death cases, 47 went directly to the
ICU because of critical condition, and 54 were transferred to ICU with aggravated
condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patient died of acute coronary
syndrome, while the rest died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by
COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females, with the age range of 24-83 and
average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had underlying diseases with
hypertension(42.57%), diabetes (22.77%), neurological disease (9.90%), malignant tumor
(4.95%), and respiratory disease( 4.95%). The cases with more than two underlying
diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history in South China
Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type
distribution was significantly different, with type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB
(8.08%) and type O (18.19%). The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days
( IQR8.00-13.50 ) . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days
( IQR17.00-27.5)(Table 1) .
3.2. Clinical Features
The relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are

shown in Table 2. The most common symptom was fever (91,90.10% of 101 patients),
but most patients presented normal temperature after 1-3 days of admission , which may
be related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also
common. Additionally, 31(30.69%) patients had white sputum in the early stage , and 3
patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. Fifty(49.50%) patients showed acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) on admission, and the median time from onset to
ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00). Other common symptoms included myalgia, general
weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among them 86(85.15%) had more
than two symptoms. Twenty one (20.79%) patients had no respiratory symptoms, and
7(6.93%) showed nausea and vomiting. Distinctive from Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), only 2 patients with COVID-19 had diarrhea.
3.3. Radiographic Findings
Most of patients (99 [98.02%] of 101 patients) had abnormal lung imaging at the
time of initial admission, 6(5.94%) patients had single-lung and 93(92.08%) had
double-lung abnormalities. The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like ground
glass in the lungs. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy shadows in
both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%) patients.
3.4. Laboratory Findings
Blood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases during admission to
ICU and 48h before deaths were collected. Most patients showed increased numbers of
leukocytes and neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes count at time of consultation.The

inflammatory indicators such as neutrophils, procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),
and interleukin-6(IL-6) gradually increased as time went on. It was found that the count
of patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased
correspondingly during disease progression by dynamic analysis of coagulation-related
indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%]
of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were
significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial
damage in the early stage. We also found that liver and kidney damages were not
significant at the time of admission and when transferred to ICU, and it significantly
turned to be worse 48h before deaths. Experiment data can be seen in Table 3-5 and
Figure1.
3.5. Treatments
Ninety seven patients were transferred to the hospital based on laboratory diagnosis
or deterioration after treatments in other hospitals. All patients were treated in isolated
wards. Among them, 61(60.40%) received antiviral drugs, including Oseltamivir,
Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ganciclovir, or Interferon, etc. Glucocorticoids,
intravenous immunoglobulins, and thymosin preparations were used in, 59(58.42%),
64(63.37%) , and 45(44.55%) patients, respectively.. All patients received antibiotic
treatment, including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients received
restricted antibiotics(63,62.38%), including carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline, etc., due
to repeated fever or fluctuation of inflammation indicators. 23(22.78%) patients received
antifungal drugs.

All patients received oxygen therapy. 84(83.17%) patients were treated with
non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy, and 77(76.24%), invasive
mechanical ventilation. The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation
was 3.00 days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before deaths.
The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1-31 days (median 5 days
[IQR2.00-8.00]). Seven patients were treated with Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation(ECMO) and eight with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy(CRRT).
4. DISCUSSION
The present analyses revealed the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths caused by
COVID-19 in China. Based on our knowledge, this is the largest sample among the
reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients although some studies described a
limited number of deaths.
Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected victims was 95,333, and
the number of deaths reached 3,282 in many countries of the world. The mortality was up
to 3.4%, which is significantly high compared with that of common pneumonia. Among
the 101 deaths, males dominated and the proportion of elderly patients with underlying
diseases was relatively high. Importantly, we found that the blood group distribution of
the deaths (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) remarkably differred from that
of Han population in Wuhan[12]. Type O was relatively low but Type A was relatively high.
ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory ,
digestive tract , and reproductive systems[13]. Previous researches have shown that ABO

blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood
group antigens may involve in virus infection as receptor[14-15]. In the study of various
susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O had a lower infection
rate[16]. Guillon et al. found that type A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting
interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor[17]. However, the higher proportion of
patients with type A blood remains unclear although the lack of antibody A protection
might be involved. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which the
patients of type A is more susceptibe to COVID-19 infection.
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with
previous studies[10], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had
fever, for instance, no fever was noted in 10(9.90%) patients on the onset of disease.
Moreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms in the begining of the
disease, and fever and chest tightness gradually occurred with the disease progressed.
Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early identification
of COVID-19 .
The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not
clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury,
inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections.
We collected laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of
transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before deaths, and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had
an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to the hospital, and it gradually
increased with the disease progressed and was up to 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h

before deaths, significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[9],indicating a
severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had abnormal
coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased D-dimer and
a sudden deterioration. Under this circumstance, attention should be paid to the
presence of pulmonary thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep
vein thrombosis. For hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable
anticoagulant therapy is a possible choice.
It has been reported that 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage function
of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, or liver, etc., but no relevant description was
seen of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected indicators of
organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that most of patients
had myocardial damage,among them 32 patients were exclusively complicated with
myocardial damage. Both 2019-nCov and 2003-SARS belong to the genus b coronavirus ,
and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common
pathogenic receptor[19]. Thirty one percent of ICU patients were found to have significant
abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) [8]. We noted that TNI was significantly elevated in the
ICU patients or before deaths compared with primary admission to hospital. Further
analysis revealed that patients who were hospitalized with elevated troponin underwent a
fast progress from onset to ICU and to death. The results suggest that heart is a potential
targeted organ by 2019-nCOV in the disease process. Thus monitoring and prediction
of heart injury would be needed at early stage as well as in the course of disease.
Additionally, we found that with the disease progressed, counts of leukocytes,

neutrophils, PCT and CRP level gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased
again after the decline, and some patients experienced a drop of body temperature and
then increased or continued fever fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the
characteristics of viral infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have
hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially bacterial infections. The sputum culture results
also indicated bacterial and fungal infections, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans in some patients. Secondary bacterial and
fungal infections may be related to suppressed immunity, lack of medical resources and
unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition, clinical manifestations of bacterial or fungal
infections in critical patients may be unconspicuous due to their compromised immunity
or hormone therapy. Therefore, it is essential to keep monitoring temperature, laboratory
indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics of the patients.
Prevention and control of nosocomial infections also needed .
In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is
still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients received antiviral drugs, 58.42%
patients were given glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All
patients received antibiotic treatments including cephalosporins and quinolones. More
than half of patients received restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations of body
temperature or inflammation indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive
treatment for critically ill patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive
mechanical ventilation was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did
not benefit significantly from invasive mechanical ventilation and had suffered multiple

organ failure caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore,
for critical patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in
consideration.
This study has some limitations. Only the critical death patients are included, and
no comparison was made between the improvement groups. The sample size can be
increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group
composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group
difference is related to the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection needs to be clarified.
5. CONCLUSION
Critical COVID-19 may cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple
organ failure with high mortality rate.The blood group distribution of the deaths
remarkably differred from that of Han population in Wuhan.Heart may be the earliest
damaged organ except the lungs. Hospital-acquired pneumonia in the later period is
worthy of attention.

the world and will continue to do so for months and perhaps years. The threats that
the disease poses to both patients and healthcare workers have changed medical practice,
but these changes can offer opportunity to those with subspecialty interests in areas
such as regional anaesthesia. Indeed, the European and American Societies of Regional
Anaesthesia have produced joint COVID-19 recommendations boldly stating that regional
anaesthesia should be preferred over general anaesthesia whenever possible, and practice
recommendations for regional anaesthesia during the pandemic have subsequently been
published.

The Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists also advise using
local or regional anaesthesia where practicable and safe in order to preserve key
drugs required during the critical care of COVID-19 patients.

Other perceived advantages of regional anaesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic may
include: a reduction in aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and thereby both increased
safety and a saving in the time, resource and financial costs of personal protective
equipment (PPE), preservation of immune function when compared with general anaesthesia,
improved postoperative analgesia minimising direct contact with care givers, and earlier
discharge. However, some of these potential benefits favour healthcare workers and
the institution rather than the patients themselves, and we must not forget that patients
are at the centre of the shared decision-making process when selecting the safest
and most effective anaesthetic technique for a surgical procedure. While the 'COVID-19
considerations' listed above are not all patient-centred, resulting changes made to
clinical practice may still directly affect the patient. As regional anaesthetists
we support the use of regional anaesthesia as the 'first choice"" anaesthetic, but
we also believe that the decision to choose regional anaesthesia must remain as patient-centred
as possible, minimising risk not only to staff and institution but also to the patient.
This is important based upon our collective anecdotal experience whereby the volume
of regional anaesthesia practice at all of the authors' institutions increased considerably
during the pandemic."

This month, a group of authors published recommendations in
Neurology
to point to the possible issues and their solutions regarding stroke care amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They offered advice and specifically addressed the potential impact of the pandemic on the quality of care, ethical considerations, safety and logistic issues, and research in stroke.
1

The paper ultimately concluded that stroke providers need to balance the overall needs of the community while remaining advocates for those with stroke and the safety of providers, including making adjustments in the delivery care that should be adapted to each unique environment. Additionally, they noted it is important to keep in mind that as care continues during the pandemic, stroke providers will need to rely on prediction modeling and surge planning to continue to adapt to best serve all patients with stroke.

Andrew N. Russman, DO, head, Stroke Program, and medical director, Comprehensive Stroke Center,
Cleveland Clinic
, and coauthors wrote that they anticipate that ongoing and emergent research will continue to offer additional insights that will provide evidence which could prompt the modification or removal of some of their recommendations.

""These [case-based] articles raise questions more than they have provided us answers about how to address this,"" Russman told
NeurologyLive
. ""With patients who present with stroke and COVID-19, we should be aware that there is more than 1 potential mechanism by which the virus may contribute to the risk of stroke. We should be vigilant about looking for these potential possibilities--not all of it is related to hypercoagulability. Some of it is related to cardiomyopathy. Some of it may be related to underlying mechanisms that the patients had regardless of COVID-19 and the state of any systemic inflammation from the virus is what might have precipitated stroke in that individual patient, just as it's been reported in other individual circumstances.""

Russman added that providing recommendations for the treatment of these patients is even more complex and based on the information that the community has to work with--which often lacks evidenced-based analysis and in-depth consistency in their investigation--the ability to create a standard approach or treatment for these patients is complicated even further.

""That's what we should take away from this--we need more data and more information, a registry of these patients, and then, potentially, randomized studies of how we're going to approach treatment in this population,"" he said.

For the delivery of stroke care, Russman et al. noted that the community should prepare for the possibility of physician shortages and that restructuring stroke call and inpatient services might be required to maintain a viable workforce of providers. Additionally, they advised that contingency plans include that neurologists with stroke expertise be prepared to assume consultative roles in different facilities as well as make treatment triage decisions in a multidisciplinary sense, similar that utilized in critical care.

They recommended that in acute stroke, all of those patients in highly contaminated areas should be approached as potentially infected. Russman and colleagues wrote that ""acute stroke is an area with high-risk for provider exposure to infection; it is a fast-paced setting, involving multiple patient interactions and limited opportunities for COVID-19 screening with patients who often have impaired cognition and language.""

Video conferencing was also recommended as a supplement to trainee education while maintaining physical distancing, which they noted has seen ""across the country at all levels of educational programming."" Protocols to protect personnel who are caring for those with acute stroke should depend on the availability and reliability of COVID-19 screening and testing, and in light of a crisis capacity mode, the role of trainees might need to be redefined, according to the recommendations.

As for research, the group acknowledged that the pandemic has created a challenge in conducting trials and studies with the risk of exposure, and wrote that ""as a research community, a reasonable conclusion is that research that does not involve in-person contact is logistically feasible,"" they wrote.

These recommendations come on the heels of growing reports of large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those younger than 50. A case-based report, recently published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
, included 5 cases of LVO stroke in the Mount Sinai Health System. All 5 patients presented over a 2-week period from March 23 to April 7, 2020, with new-onset symptoms of large-vessel ischemic stroke and a positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17, and 1 patient had a history of stroke.
2

The authors noted that by comparison, every 2 weeks over the previous 12 months, the service had treated 0.73 patients younger than 50 years of age with large-vessel stroke on average. Two of the patients in the series delayed calling an ambulance due to fears about going to a hospital during the pandemic.
2

""It's a multifactorial disease--in most cases, it's the result of just wear and tear on the vasculature and the blood clotting system and the structures that support blood supply to the brain, which we talk about in terms of risk factors. We'll often find a spectrum of potential contributors to somebody stroke but finding an actual smoking gun isn't usually how that works,"" Payne explained. ""We do certainly find smoking guns, but mostly its risks that we manage, so it's a little early in our experience with stroke and COVID to clearly say, 'Yes, it's a risk for stroke,' but it's certainly bubbling up and the little hints we've had here and there are quite compelling.""

In recent weeks, those hints have continued to come. One recent assessment suggested that the pandemic may have a negative impact on care for those with acute conditions, finding that the number of patients who underwent imaging decreased by 39%, from 1.18 patients per day per hospital in the pre-pandemic 29-day epoch from February 1 to February 29, 2020, to 0.72 patients per day per hospital in the 14-day epoch during the early pandemic from March 26 to April 8, 2020. The authors wrote that this apparent increase in patients undergoing imaging after the early-pandemic epoch warrants further investigation.
3

Another assessment published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
that included data on 231,753 patients who underwent imaging in 856 hospitals in the United States from July 1, 2019, to April 27, 2020, noted that there was a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which the authors noted is ""remarkably high."" They added that the findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. As well, they wrote that the data are strongly suggestive that prophylaxis should increase towards high-prophylactic doses--even without randomized evidence.
4

""We see that some people tend to have abnormal markers of blood clotting when they have COVID--stroke or not,"" Payne said. ""We'll see, for example, that that the things that we see in their lungs may not be typical or traditional pulmonary disease but may actually have to do with clots forming in the small arteries, and maybe that's what's happening in their kidneys. Now, we've taken to looking at sort of the clotting profile of patients we've seen recently with stroke and COVID, and we're finding it's quite abnormal. We're finding that not only the numbers are abnormal, but patients clinically seem to respond better to earlier use of blood-thinning medications and sometimes even clot-buster medicines to clear up some of these clotting issues that we'll see.""

""How that all shakes out, I think, is going to be very interesting and is actually going to teach us some important lessons about how blood clotting works and how vascular biology works. There are things to be learned there,"" Payne added."

The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients.

In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 Considering presence of the virus in body fluids of patients, a potential risk of tear and conjunctival transmission of exists.2 However the transmission route of this virus remains unclear yet believed through aerosols.2 As-on-date, we have a limited understanding of the ocular complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The point worth writing this letter was to understand whether subjecting the conjunctival and tear secretions using disposable sampling swabs to laboratory testing by the Ophthalmologist be helpful? Anecdotal reports have given a pointer that SARS-CoV-2 may exist in samples in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients with conjunctivitis.2,3 Research in Singapore also revealed positive test results in three out of 34 highly suspected COVID-19 cases.4 An isolated report from a case in China suggested that viral loads in conjunctival specimens and the potential for transmission gradually decrease over time.5The standard conjunctival swab technique is used to collect the samples by wiping the conjunctiva of the lower eyelid fornix of the patient's eyes without anesthesia. The transfer and storage of these samples in virus transport media is as per routine COVID-19 testing protocol.1In many centers testing for the usual adenoviral conjunctivitis using real transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique is a standard operating procedure. This technique detects viral nucleic acid and has a high sensitivity and specificity with added advantage of being simple, convenient, efficient when compared to culture. Sample contamination and damage to genetic material are standard risks. To add, researchers in Hong Kong obtained negative results on PCR from conjunctival sample in all their confirmed study subjects of COVID-19. World Health organization does not currently recommend the use of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care, although research into their diagnostic utility is highly encouraged. Clinical decision making should not be based on these tests unless specific evidence exists. Unless the virus is seen to be causing significant ophthalmic manifestations as seen in ZIKA, conjunctival swabs as a routine to merely understand viral tropism in the eye may not be ideal. Conjunctival swab may be helpful to distinguish the cause for isolated conjunctivitis as a presenting feature of COVID-19 in high risk zones but needs further validation. It would be wise to realize that regional viral extent will direct personal protective equipment usage. Future research will define the infectious potential and mechanism of tropism of SARS-CoV-2 within ocular tissues. What we can understand as of now is that testing to see whether tears alone will transmit the virus in asymptomatic cases may be considered but this risk in miniscule especially if the patient is totally asymptomatic.

Although most cases of COVID-19 are paucisymptomatic, severe disease is characterized by immune dysregulation, with a decreased type I interferon response, increased inflammatory indicators, surging IL-6, IL-10 and TNFa suggestive of cytokine storm, progressive lymphopenia, and abnormal blood clotting. Factors determining susceptibility to severe disease are poorly understood, although mortality correlates with increasing age and co-morbidities including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) tends to be insufficient in populations particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, including the elderly, the institutionalized, and people with diabetes and CVD, and PLP becomes further depleted during infection and inflammation. In turn, low PLP results in immune imbalance, as PLP is an essential cofactor in pathways regulating cytokine production, in particular type I interferons and IL-6, and in lymphocyte trafficking and endothelial integrity. Furthermore, normalizing PLP levels attenuates abnormalities in platelet aggregation and clot formation. Finally, PLP insufficiency induces excess secretion of renin and angiotensin, and hypertension. In inflammatory disease, pharmacological doses of PLP decrease circulating TNFa, IL-6 and D-dimer, and animal studies demonstrate that supplemental PLP shortens the duration and severity of viral pneumonia. Severe COVID-19 manifests as an imbalance in the immune response and the clotting system. Pharmacological PLP supplementation may therefore mitigate COVID-19 symptoms by alleviating both the immune suppression underlying viral spread and the pathological hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines, as well as directly bolstering endothelial integrity and preventing hypercoagulability.

An 84-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension was brought to the emergency department in respiratory distress after being found at home with oxygen saturation of 40%. The patient reported fever, shortness of breath, cough, and abdominal pain for 2 weeks leading up to presentation. On examination, he was found to have a nonreactive, pinpoint left pupil and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Laboratory analysis revealed lymphopenia of 0.29 x 10
3
/uL, procalcitonin of 0.25 ng/mL, elevated D-dimer of 21.6 mcg/mL, and elevated troponin T of 35 ng/mL. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) COVID-19 testing was positive. As his respiratory status deteriorated, the patient was expeditiously intubated.

CT of the chest performed on the night of admission revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities and bibasilar consolidations compatible with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, as described in a recent consensus statement (
1
). In addition, chest CT demonstrated bilateral lobar pulmonary emboli (
Fig 1
). The patient was started on a low-molecular-weight heparin infusion. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed concurrently with the chest CT, demonstrated a new left renal infarct (
Fig 2
).

, Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates a filling defect in the aortic arch (arrow) consistent with thrombus.
B
, Coronal contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a wedge-shaped low-attenuation region in the superior pole of the left kidney (arrow) consistent with renal infarct.

Given the patient's unequal pupils, CT of the head and CT angiography of the head and neck were obtained on the night of admission, revealing occlusion of the distal basilar artery, which extended into the proximal posterior cerebral arteries (
Fig 3
). There was a small thrombus in the aortic arch (
Fig 2
). The patient was taken emergently for catheter angiography, followed by mechanical thrombectomy with subsequent restoration of blood flow (
Fig 3
). Despite all treatment measures, the patient rapidly decompensated and succumbed to his illness the next day.

This case illustrates severe coagulopathy in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. Possible explanations of his multifocal thromboembolic disease involving the pulmonary, cerebral, and renal circulations include coagulopathy due to COVID-19 versus cardioembolic etiology in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Given that the patient had no known hypercoagulable conditions and no prior history of atrial fibrillation, the latter etiology was felt to be less likely.

There are emerging global reports of coagulopathy in the setting of COVID-19, including pulmonary emboli, cerebral infarcts, and limb ischemia (

). A recent publication identified antiphospholipid antibodies in a COVID-19 patient with significant coagulopathy (
5
). It has also been proposed that coagulopathy may portend a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients and may require early intervention (

). Our case supports the growing body of data by demonstrating a poor outcome in a patient with multifocal thromboembolic disease in the setting of COVID-19."

Abstract

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been reported in almost every country in the world. Although a large proportion of infected individuals develop only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the spectrum of the disease among others has been widely variable in severity. Besides, many infected individuals were found to have coagulation markers abnormalities, especially true among those progressing to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. While the incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease has been recently noted to be elevated among critically ill patients, the incidence among ambulatory and non-critically ill patients is not yet clearly defined. Herein, we present six patients who didn't have any hypercoagulable risk factors yet presented with pulmonary embolism in association with COVID 19 infection. Furthermore, we discuss the possible underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability and highlight the possibility of underdiagnosing pulmonary embolism in the setting of overlapping symptoms, decreased utilization of imaging secondary to associated risks, and increased turnover times. In addition, we emphasize the role of extended thromboprophylaxis in discharged patients."

Reunion Island (845 000 inhabitants) is a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean at a distance of 10 000 km from Paris. One hundred and thirty-five cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Reunion Island as of 26 March 2020 (first case detected on 19 March 2020). More than 90% of these cases came from metropolitan France on long-haul flights. On 22 March 2020, a 50-year-old male patient with no medical history presented to the Reunion Island University Hospital with signs of upper respiratory infection accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea and fever. These signs appeared on 17 March 2020, 6 days after he returned to Reunion Island from metropolitan France, where there was an outbreak of COVID-19.

On clinical examination, the patient had a room saturation of 94%, a respiratory rate of 20/min and a temperature of 38.4degC. Pulmonary auscultation revealed only a few crackles at the bases. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. Biological tests showed a leucocyte count of 6.2 g/l (lymphocyte count of 0.71 g/l), C-reactive protein levels of 1.8 mg/l, brain natriuretic peptide levels <10 ng/l, hs-troponin-T levels <10 ng/l, D-dimer levels of 3.02 mg/ml and a PaO
2
of 83 mmHg. A chest X-ray showed no abnormality. In light of this presentation, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 23 March 2020 and tested positive for COVID-19. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated with a fever of 38.4degC, requiring the administration of oxygen at 3 l/min. Given the discrepancy between his hypoxemia and the chest X-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast injection was performed on 24 March 2020 (7 days after the onset of symptoms). The chest CT scan showed parenchymal damage indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia of moderate severity with lobar and segmental pulmonary embolism involving the middle lobe with a CO-RADS score of 5 (
Figure 1 a
and
b
). The patient was treated with effective anticoagulation (enoxaparin 8000 IU/12 h). The global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been shown to occur through travel.

Long-haul flight travel is a known risk factor of pulmonary embolism.

Only one case of pulmonary embolism was reported during the MERS and SARS coronavirus epidemics.
4
A retrospective series suggests that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may be at risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
5
The case described here reinforces this hypothesis. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 infections exhibit state of hyperinflammation and coagulopathy, frequently hypoxemia leading to inactivity and prolonged bed rest. Accordingly, clinicians should consider looking for this complication in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who have travelled on long-haul flights.

Axial computed tomography pulmonary angiography performed on Day 7 after onset of symptoms. (A) Thrombus (arrow) can be seen in the right middle lobe pulmonary artery. (B) Lung window shows moderate impairment.

BACKGROUND

Emerging reports indicate a high incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia during the spring 2020 pandemic. The pronounced pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses observed in these patients may contribute to a transient hypercoagulable state. In this setting, pulmonary embolism may cause further respiratory distress and clinical deterioration.

CASE PRESENTATION

We describe the clinical course of three patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress, where pulmonary embolism was detected during the course of the hospitalisation. Two of the cases occurred despite early institution of standard dosage of low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis, and in one case, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed during the convalescent phase of an otherwise benign COVID-19 disease course.

INTERPRETATION

These cases highlight the importance of awareness of the potentially increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 disease. Further research is required to establish appropriate clinical management guidelines for prevention of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.

Artikkel

Here we describe pulmonary embolism in three patients at different stages of COVID-19. The development of pulmonary embolism can be easy to overlook if respiratory failure and hypoxemia are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

The clinical picture associated with COVID-19 is complicated by severe acute phase reactions and widespread inflammation in the lungs. Pulmonary embolism can also occur in COVID-19 patients who receive thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, and infection control considerations should not be an obstacle to essential diagnostic imaging.

Patient 1

A man in his seventies with type 2 diabetes was hospitalised after three days of fever with lower back and abdominal pain. Upon admission, he was found to have respiratory alkalosis and mild tachypnoea. A chest X-ray showed subtle opacities in basal areas of the right lung, suggestive of pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in bronchial secretions. The patient remained tachypnoeic despite receiving supplemental O
2
at 2 l/min. He was also given enoxaparin 40 mg x 1 as thromboprophylaxis. A chest X-ray on day 4 revealed increased opacities bilaterally, which had progressed further by day 8.

From day 9, the patient showed increasing oxygen demand, and required 10 l/min via a non-rebreathing mask to maintain SpO
2
> 94 %. He was gradually becoming increasingly tired and weak. A chest X-ray on day 12 showed the lung opacities to be largely unchanged. Owing to a lack of improvement in oxygenation and a strong and sustained increase in D-dimer levels to > 10 mg/ml (Figure 1), CT pulmonary angiography was performed on day 15. This revealed bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolisms, in addition to widespread infection-related opacities (Figures 2a-b). After initiation of anticoagulation therapy (enoxaparin 100 mg x 2), the patient's oxygen demand slowly decreased and his general condition rapidly improved.

Figure 1
Timeline for levels of D-dimer (fibrinogen equivalent units, FEU) in plasma (p) and ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum (s) in patients 1 and 2. The x-axis shows the number of days after hospitalisation. The dashed line indicates D-dimer levels > 35.2 mg/l, beyond which no further dilutions for quantitation were performed. D-dimer levels showed marked dynamic variation in both patients over the disease course, with an increase to double-digit values   prior to CT angiography and discovery of the pulmonary embolisms (arrows). * indicates the point at which immunomodulatory therapy (anakinra) was initiated in patient 2. This was attempted owing to greatly elevated ferritin levels and persistently high D-dimer. A rapid decline in inflammation parameters was observed after the start of treatment, but without any significant improvement in clinical condition. The lower right panel shows the P/F oxygen ratio, which represents the patients' oxygen demand over the disease course. This is the ratio of the oxygen pressure in arterial blood (PaO
2
) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
2
). For patient 1, PaO
2
has been estimated from the oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry by means of a conversion table.

Figure 2
CT pulmonary angiography with coronal maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstructions. The images show pulmonary embolisms in lower lobe pulmonary arteries in all three patients (a, c, e, arrows). Patients 1 (a, b) and 2 (c, d) also had bilateral opacities with features consistent with an infectious origin and a largely peripheral distribution that can be seen more clearly in the lung window (b, d). In patient 3 (e, f), a broad-based, rounded consolidation can be seen against the pleura at the base of the left lower lobe, most consistent with pulmonary infarction (f). Ground-glass opacities can be seen around the infarct, lungs are otherwise clear.

Patient 2

A previously healthy man in his late seventies was hospitalised after three days of high fever, dry cough and reduced general condition. He was not dyspnoeic, but had hypoxemia with SpO
2
90 % in room air. A chest X-ray upon admission was normal. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in bronchial secretions. He was given enoxaparin 40 mg x 1 as thromboprophylaxis. A further chest X-ray on day 1 revealed new bilateral opacities. By day 2, he was weaker and showed greater oxygen demand. He became tachypnoeic on day 3, and an X-ray showed progression of the pulmonary opacities. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated.

Based on reports of increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in intensive care patients with COVID-19, we decided to increase the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin to 40 mg x 2. On day 7, the patient's D-dimer levels increased from 2.8 to 24 mg/l. His ferritin level was > 2 000 ug/ml and treatment with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) was initiated on day 10. Radiological progression of the pulmonary opacities was seen up to day 13, while D-dimer levels decreased after initiation of anakinra (Figure 1). However, owing to a renewed increase in D-dimer from 16 mg/ml to 26 mg/ml, CT pulmonary angiography was performed on day 16. This revealed bilateral peripheral pulmonary embolisms and widespread opacities in all lobes (Figures 2c-d). Anticoagulation therapy (enoxaparin 100 mg x 2) was initiated, but after a long disease course with severe respiratory failure that did not improve, the patient died on day 22.

Patient 3

A previously healthy woman in her seventies experienced a week of illness with mild dry cough and upper respiratory tract symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in bronchial secretions after two days. After being free of symptoms for two weeks, the patient again developed a dry cough and was hospitalised 23 days after symptom onset, with activity-related dyspnoea and tachypnoea. Upon admission, she had respiratory alkalosis and a D-dimer level of 1.9 mg/ml. Chest X-ray was normal. CT pulmonary angiography was performed, and revealed bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolisms affecting all lobes, but no opacities suggestive of infection (Figures 2e-f). She received oral anticoagulant therapy (apixaban 10 mg x 2) and was discharged when she showed improvement.

Discussion

These case studies demonstrate that pulmonary embolism may contribute to hypoxemia at various stages of the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when in the disease course this complication arose. In patients 1 and 2, high D-dimer levels were first attributed to a strong acute phase response to the infection (Figure 1). As the patients had been treated with low molecular weight heparin throughout their time in hospital, pulmonary embolism was not suspected until later in the disease course. Several studies have reported that high D-dimer levels (> 1.0 mg/ml) upon admission are associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (
1
-
3
), but the causal relationship is likely to be multifactorial.

In patient 2, a sharp rise in serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin (Figure 1) was observed in the course of the disease. It has been reported that severe disease related to the coronavirus may be associated with the emergence of a hyperinflammatory state (cytokine storm) as part of the immune response to the virus (
4
), and there has been speculation over whether immunomodulatory therapy may be helpful in this regard. Given our patient's severe and persistent respiratory failure, we therefore decided to try immunomodulatory therapy with anakinra. After treatment initiation, we observed rapidly decreasing levels of D-dimer, CRP and ferritin (Figure 1), but no sign of any clinically significant improvement. This, in conjunction with a renewed increase in the D-dimer level, raised suspicion of pulmonary embolism.

In many patients COVID-19 leads to a prolonged disease course with high fever, reduced general condition and pulmonary involvement, all of which contribute to immobilisation. Treatment in intensive care in itself represents a significant risk factor for thromboembolic disease. Acute infections are associated with a significant but transient increase in the risk of venous thromboembolic events (
5
). Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated thromboembolic disease is still limited. Both the viral infection itself and the accompanying antiviral immune response entail a risk of vigorous activation of the coagulation system as a result of endothelial damage, platelet activation, and the release of potent proinflammatory cytokines (
6
). It is also suspected that endothelial damage may result in marked complement activation, thereby triggering a thrombotic microangiopathy similar to that seen in atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (
7
). The high incidence of pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19 is presumably due to a combination of inflammation-mediated damage to pulmonary tissue (
3
) and systemic hypercoagulability.

Several publications have reported a strikingly high incidence of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients. The condition has been detected in 20-30 % of patients in whom CT pulmonary angiography was performed on the basis of clinical indication (
8
-
11
). Biochemical and functional signs of hypercoagulability have been described in seriously ill COVID-19 patients and seem to be associated with a poor prognosis (
1
,
2
,
8
,
12
,
13
).

Among 184 intensive care patients in the Netherlands, 27 % had CT/ultrasound-confirmed venous thromboembolic events, 81 % of whom (25 patients) had pulmonary embolism (
8
). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was detected in one patient. Increased global coagulation parameters (INR, activated partial thromboplastin time) were predictors of thromboembolic complications. This suggests that coagulopathy may contribute to the development of pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19 (
8
). It is worth noting that these patients received thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. However, the doses differed across the various hospitals in the study, and also increased over time according to the article. At one of the centres, the prophylactic dose was doubled over the course of the observation period to two daily doses, and the authors argue in light of the strikingly high incidence of pulmonary embolism that this practice must be considered for intensive care patients with COVID-19 (
8
).

In the Dutch study, diagnostic imaging was performed only on clinical suspicion, and the overall incidence of thromboembolic disease may therefore be even higher (
8
). In seven of 25 patients with pulmonary embolism, only subsegmental embolisms were found. The clinical consequences of such peripheral thrombosis probably vary, depending on the extent of the infection-triggered parenchymal damage.

We have been informed by infectious disease and intensive care communities in Norway that a strikingly high incidence of thromboembolic complications has also been observed in COVID-19 patients here, despite the use of standard prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin (at our hospital, enoxaparin 40 mg x 1). Based on this information and our own experience, we have decided to use an increased prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (40 mg x 2) for some of these patients in our department. Systematic studies of the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism will be valuable for revealing the extent of such disease in hospitalised COVID-19 patients and for clarifying the underlying pathophysiology.

In our hospital, CT scans have only been used to a very limited degree for routine diagnostics in COVID-19 patients, primarily because inflammatory changes can readily be seen on a standard chest X-ray, but also because of infection control considerations. In view of the high incidence of pulmonary embolism in this patient group, more widespread use of CT angiography should be considered in patients with persistently high oxygen demand and biochemical signs of hyperinflammation, as well as in the event of D-dimer levels that are either very high or show marked variation.

Conclusion

Physicians who manage patients with COVID-19 both in and outside hospitals must be alert to the high incidence of thromboembolic complications in this patient group. Effective prophylaxis and rapid detection of any pulmonary embolisms will probably enable more patients to be treated successfully. CT pulmonary angiography should therefore be considered for patients with severe disease even if they are already being treated with low molecular weight heparin.

With limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and an absence of data from randomised controlled trials, it is difficult to formulate guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in cases of COVID-19. The incidence of bleeding complications should also be further surveyed. Whether increased prophylactic or therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin are indicated for the entire patient population, or only for those groups of patients thought to be at particularly high risk, has still to be determined. While we await the results of systematic studies, clinical practice should be based on consensus and experience from different centres nationally and internationally."

Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ravaged the global society as we know it. As almost a dozen pharmaceutical agents go into randomized controlled clinical trials, multiple studies have surfaced trying to associate a hypercoagulable state to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We report two COVID-19 cases who presented with occlusive pulmonary embolism (PE) strongly supporting a hypercoagulable state incurred by SARS-CoV-2. This is significant as it is one of the early reports of such an initial presentation of COVID-19 in the USA. Through our report, we invite the medical community to share a perspective about long-term management guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prompt future research."

Introduction
Governor Cuomo recently stated, ""We will lose people -the virus takes the most vulnerable. The challenge is
to make sure we don't lose anyone else we could have saved.""
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, known as COVID-19, was first described in China in
December 20191. A global pandemic followed in the months to come, leading to devastating consequences. By
April 26, COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries, infecting more than 2.9 million people, resulting in
greater than 200,000 deaths globally2. The suspected index case of COVID-19 infection leading to the New
York City/Westchester outbreak was described in a man who became ill on February 22. By the third week of
March, New York City became an epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Nearly 1 million
Americans have been infected with the virus and New York accounts for 29% of these infections. Never in our
lifetime have so many people fallen ill simultaneously. The rapid increase in hospitalizations has challenged
the delivery of healthcare in unprecedented ways. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in up to 25% of
patients with severe COVID-19 infection3-4. The volume of patients with severe AKI in a single hospital poses
unique challenges for the nephrologist including 1) infection prevention 2) workforce 3) dialysis resources and
4) communication. We report our experience providing care to hospitalized patients with AKI in the Bronx
during the first month of the outbreak.
The Bronx Experience: Acute kidney injury in COVID-19 infected patients
Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), located in the North Bronx in close proximity to Westchester County, has
been one of the main urban tertiary care centers for patients in New York City with Covid-19 infection.
Montefiore's two main campuses are Moses and Weiler Hospitals. Moses Hospital is a 726-bed hospital with 5
intensive care units (47 beds) and Weiler Hospital is a 431-bed hospital with 2 intensive care units (32 beds).
Each hospital has 10 clinical nephrology faculty and 4 nephrology fellows. Moses and Weiler Hospitals have 20
and 12 full time dialysis nurses, respectively. Prior to COVID-19, there were 2 nephrology consult services and
2 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) services at Moses Hospital and 1 nephrology consult service and 1 ESKD
service at Weiler Hospital. One nephrologist with a fellow or physician assistant staffed each service. The
average number of consults for AKI was 10-15 per day at each hospital and average census of each consult
service was 20-25 patients.
On March 10, the first confirmed COVID-19 infected patient was transferred from Westchester to MMC. This
patient had AKI and immediately required renal replacement therapy (RRT). By April 6, the number of COVID-
19 patients increased to 877. Simultaneously, there was a significant increase in the number of consults for
AKI associated with COVID-19 infection and in those who needed acute RRT. (Table 1) Between March 10
and March 30, there were 112 nephrology consults for AKI. The average age of these patients was 63 years;
69% were men, the majority were black or hispanic, and diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney
disease and obesity were prevalent comorbidities. Most presented to the emergency department with AKI or
started to develop AKI within 24 hours of admission, underscoring their severity of illness at presentation. The
average time to RRT was 7 days and the most common indications for RRT were hyperkalemia and volume
overload. Approximately 54% required ICU admission and 46% required RRT. To handle these high acuity
patients, the number of ICU beds increased by 60% and the number of nephrology services was expanded.

Infection prevention
Mitigating transmission of COVID-19 infection to other patients and hospital staff has been a major priority. To
prevent spread of infection, initially all COVID-19 infected patients requiring RRT received hemodialysis (HD)
treatments at bedside. In order to expand the capability of providing bedside HD, hospital rooms were re-
plumbed for access to the central reverse osmosis (RO) system, portable RO were used and 10 additional HD
machines were purchased from Fresenius. A limitation in providing bedside HD was the requirement of 1:1
nursing. As the number of COVID-19 infected patients increased, there was also a 2-3-fold increase in the
number of patients requiring bedside HD. To accommodate the increase in patients requiring bedside HD,
ESKD patients were placed on a twice weekly schedule and treatments were shortened using higher blood and
dialysate flow for those who could tolerate it. Those with AKI were managed with maximal medical
management to delay RRT initiation. A novel approach to prevent or slow hyperkalemia from developing was
initiation of potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) in patients with a serum potassium
4
between 4.0-5.0 meq/L that was rising. Non-oliguric patients were placed on diuretics to maintain euvolemia.
Whenever possible, the number of staff entering infected patient rooms was limited to minimize exposure and
preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Nephrology teams performed remote assessment by reviewing
the electronic record, laboratory data and imaging. The most common reason for the nephrologist to directly
interact with a COVID-19 infected patient was to discuss initiation of RRT or to place acute dialysis access.
Tele-monitoring was piloted using baby monitors with two-way video and audio positioned next to the patient
and dialysis machine, allowing the nurse to monitor the patient remotely during treatment. Tubing extension for
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was purchased to allow positioning of CRRT machines outside
of the ICU rooms so the nurses could adjust ultrafiltration rates and check on machine alarms without the need
to put on PPE to perform this task. Despite these interventions, capacity was reached in providing bedside HD
near the end of March. After consultation with infection control, the CDC recommendation to cohort COVID-19
infected patients together on the last shift of the day in the inpatient HD unit was used5-6.
Workforce
By the third week of March, the volume of patients with COVID-19 associated AKI and acute RRT needs
increased significantly. Nephrology services were expanded to handle the increase in consults for AKI. Moses
Hospital increased from 4 to 7 services and Weiler Hospital increased from 2 to 3 services. The average daily
census of each service was 20-25 patients. Providers identified as high risk for severe complications from
COVID-19 infection (greater than 65 years old or pregnant) were relocated from inpatient services to lower risk
settings including night call coverage, electronic inpatient nephrology consults and outpatient office and
hemodialysis telemedicine visits. Further complicating staffing was more than a 50% reduction in available
dialysis nurses and technicians due to illness for 2 weeks. As a result, nephrologists assisted with HD by
priming the machines, monitoring patients during the dialysis treatments and achieving hemostasis to the
access at the end of the treatment. On March 29, the inpatient HD unit opened on Sundays to meet the
number of patients requiring acute RRT.
Dialysis Resources
The availability of dialysis resources decreased due to the surge in COVID-19 patients with AKI requiring
RRT7. CRRT is the preferred treatment modality in patients presenting with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and prone positioning. However, patients with this presentation quickly
depleted the ability to provide CRRT for 24-hour periods per patient. Treatment times were reduced and
dialysate flow rates were increased to convert CRRT to prolonged intermittent renal replacement treatments
(PIRRT). PIRRT was performed for 6-12 hour treatments with effluent flow rates of 40-50 ml/kg/hr. This
permitted use of 1 machine for 2-3 patients with time for disinfection in between patients. Despite these
adaptions, the surge in patients required creation of 11 additional ICUs. As a result, the nurse to patient ratio
increased significantly which made it impossible for ICU nurses to manage 1:1 nursing requirements for
PIRRT. Perfusionists who ordinarily manage extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures were
reassigned and assumed the role of PIRRT management during the day. Prior to the International Society of
Thrombosis and Hemostasis guidance for the recognition and management of the hypercoagulable state in
patients with COVID-19, ICU patients on CRRT were observed to have increased clotting of catheters and
filters despite therapeutic heparin infusion (PTT 2x normal) which led to frequent treatment interruptions and
difficulty in achieving adequate clearance.9 To resolve the issue with clotting on CRRT, a non-validated
bivalirudin protocol was initiated with close monitoring of PTT8.
By early April, our COVID-19 RRT census included 25-30 patients with AKI on CRRT or PIRRT, 20 patients
with AKI on HD and 65 ESKD patients on HD. To meet the increasing need for acute RRT, an acute peritoneal
dialysis (PD) service was created. Transplant surgeons placed Tenkhoff catheters at bedside in intubated
patients and interventional radiologists placed catheters in floor patients via fluoroscopy. Within 1 week, 18
patients were initiated on acute PD. Manual PD exchanges were initiated immediately after catheter placement
using 1-2 liter dwells with exchanges every 2-3 hours. Major barriers identified in effective delivery of this
modality have been nurse training and frequent prone positioning of ventilated patients. To overcome these
barriers, nephrologists and fellows received in-service training on how to perform manual PD exchanges and
5
have been assisting nursing staff with limited experience. Additionally, PD cyclers were purchased from Baxter
which reduced workload and staff exposure. The majority of patients with AKI requiring acute RRT who were
selected for PD were non-intubated, hemodynamically stable patients. CRRT or PIRRT was preferentially used
in patients who were hemodynamically unstable, those requiring prone positioning for ARDS and those with
severe electrolyte abnormalities.
Communication
Bedside evaluation has plays an important role in AKI management. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic
there has been a shortage of PPE. In an effort to preserve PPE, daily patient contact by specialists has been
minimized. This has been a challenge, as intravascular volume assessment is important in determination of
need for IV fluids, diuretics or RRT in those with AKI. Many patients with COVID-19 associated AKI also
present with respiratory failure and chest x-ray findings of bilateral lung opacities with a ground glass
appearance that is difficult to distinguish from pulmonary edema. In these patients, the desire to reduce
hypervolemia to optimize respiratory status must be balanced against over-diuresis which may further
exacerbate AKI. Point-of-care ultrasound has been useful in assessing intravascular volume status, as well as
frequent communication with the primary teams and reliance on their physical exam findings. To limit
indwelling bladder catheters, nurses have been performing bladder scans to rule out urinary retention and
determine urine output for intake and output assessment.
Conclusion
""Often out of periods of losing come the greatest strivings toward a new winning streak.""
Despite the enormous challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, this experience has taught us how to
be resourceful in maximizing availability of acute AKI and RRT services to meet the needs of our patients,
even in the most trying circumstances. The best advice we can offer from New York to nephrologists across
the world where COVID-19 may still be in its early stages is the following: plan ahead, get creative, support
each other and work together. Hopefully we will never see another pandemic in our lifetime but if we do...we
will be prepared.

The first case of COVID-19 in the Netherlands was confirmed on Feb 27, 2020, and the patient was put on mechanical ventilation in our ICU department at Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, Netherlands). Currently, our department is the largest COVID-19 ICU in the Netherlands. We would like to share our findings regarding a possible mechanism of progressive respiratory failure.

From the date of the first confirmed case up to April 5, a total of 90 patients were admitted to our ICU, most of whom were male (n=68 [76%]), of older age (mean age 62 years [SD 14]), and obese (mean body-mass index 29 kg/m
2
[SD 5]). Treatment consisted of prone positioning, low tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the higher PEEP, lower fraction of inspired oxygen table,

and restrictive fluid management. These methods resulted in low driving pressures, no pneumothoraxes, low vasopressor doses, and weaning from mechanical ventilation approximately 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, some patients (n=17 [19%]) deteriorated within 2 weeks and no longer responded to prone positioning. All of these patients had major pulmonary embolism established by lung CT or cardiac ultrasound.

Initially, patients with COVID-19 on our ICU developed increased alveolar capillary permeability and subsequent interstitial oedema. The presence of oedema is illustrated by ground-glass opacities of the lung parenchyma on lung CT.

On our ICU, five further patients had progressive respiratory failure, in whom we did lung CT and found pulmonary embolism, either located centrally or segmentally, in all cases. In addition, we were confronted with these patients developing deep venous thrombosis, and frequent coagulation of renal replacement therapy filters. We hypothesise that the patients with COVID-19 with pulmonary embolism entered a hypercoagulable state with endothelial activation following an increase in proinflammatory cytokines.

An association between increased coagulation status and increased capillary permeability might exist. A plasma D-dimer concentration greater than 4 mg/mL, combined with increasing inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and loss of response to prone positioning might be useful parameters to identify patients at risk of pulmonary embolism. Based on our early findings in our first 90 patients with COVID-19, we now include D-dimer and IL-6 in our routine laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and increase the prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin(nadroparin 5700 IU subcutaneously, from once a day to twice a day).

In addition, we do a lung CT even at a low level of suspicion of pulmonary embolism, and we encourage others to do the same.

In summary, COVID-19 might be associated with hypercoagulability, and clinicians should consider a pulmonary embolism in cases of progressive respiratory failure.

Abstract

Objective

Approximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or ""cytokine storm"". Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point.

Methods

Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC).

Results

In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8 +- 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.

Conclusion

Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key."

Abstract

As physicians specializing in
rehabilitation
medicine consider sequelae from the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in 2019, one issue that should be top of mind is the physiologic effect that large-scale social distancing had on the health of patients in general but, more specifically, on preoperative patients who had their surgeries delayed or will have newly scheduled procedures during the peripandemic period. Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate
a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even
if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection.
Therefore, now is the time to consider for patients awaiting surgery a wider adoption of
prehabilitation
--physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments."

This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is to support clinicians and, although recommendations have been provided, it is not a formal guideline. Nor is there sufficient evidence base to conclude that alternative approaches to treatment are incorrect. Instead, it is a consensus written by clinicians with an interest in ITP or coagulation disorders and reviewed by members of the UK ITP forum.

Background

The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), poses a number of dilemmas for the investigation of thrombocytopenia and the management of patients with ITP.

This includes consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of standard therapeutic options for new or relapsed acute ITP, as well as recognition of the challenges posed to the management of ITP patients due to both bleeding and thrombotic risks seen in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, patients are often unclear about the extent of required self-isolation procedures.

Thrombocytopenia and COVID-19

Thrombocytopenia was noted in 36% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in one of the early studies,
11
although subsequent researchers have confirmed this is usually mild. The hyper-inflammatory state and cytokine storm induced by the viral infection results in a prothrombotic state, and likely endothelial and platelet activation occurs.
32
Thrombocytopenia is usually multifactorial in critically ill patients. Its pathogenesis is likely to be more complex than the conventional model of platelet consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, and the use of antibiotics, antivirals, heparin and other commonly used agents, as well as haemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may contribute in some cases. Furthermore, platelet production may be affected by direct viral insult to the bone marrow
17
or reduced effect of thrombopoietin.
3
In end stage COVID-19 infection, multi-organ failure may exacerbate thrombocytopenia, and pooled results of nine studies involving 1779 COVID-19 positive patients revealed that the platelet count was lower in those with very severe disease (
P
< 0*001).
20
Indeed, the lower the platelet count, the worse the prognosis. This was supported by a recent, large, single-centre study from Wuhan involving 1,476 consecutive patients with COVID-19, showing mortality increasing with progressively lower platelet counts.
37
This is perhaps not unexpected, as other studies of critically ill patents show thrombocytopenia to be a marker of poor clinical outcome.
24
Huang
et al
. found 20% of COVID-19 patients who died had a platelet count <100 x 10
9
/l, compared with 1% of survivors (
P
< 0*0001).
13

Despite the numerous potential causes of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 positive patients, a count below 100 x 10
9
/l is unusual, only occurring in around 5% of hospitalised patients and 8% of those on ITU.
13
Postulated mechanisms for the relative preservation of platelet count are increased thrombopoietin production from liver stimulation and megakaryocytes in the lung producing large amounts of platelets.
31
Very low platelet counts of <20 x 10
9
/l, or a sudden fall in the platelet count >50% over 24-48 h, is likely to indicate an immune aetiology, although this can also occur in the pre-terminal stages of COVID-19. Immune causes, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and atypical haemolytic uraemia syndrome, should be considered if there is associated microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) and, in the former, an ADAMTS13 level <10%. Experience of testing COVID-19 patients without TTP has found ADAMTS13 levels of 20-40%, typical of other inflammatory states. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia develops at a median of 14 days after the onset of a new drug, or sooner if there has been previous exposure. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs between 5 and 10 days after the first exposure, or within 24 h of recurrent exposure. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is a diagnosis of exclusion, there being no confirmative test.

Recommendation

Very low platelet counts of <20 x 10
9
/l, or a sudden fall in the platelet count >50% over 24-48 h, may indicate an immune aetiology.

Other causes of immune thrombocytopenia, such as HIT, MAHA and drugs, should be considered before a diagnosis of ITP is made.

Management of new/relapsed ITP

Like all viral infections, COVID-19 may trigger a new presentation of ITP, as illustrated in a recently published case report,
38
or it may cause relapse in an existing patient. The need to actively treat ITP is unchanged from current consensus guidelines;
26
however, the additional potential burden of treatment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., greater hospital contact and immunosuppression and/or thrombotic risk) needs to be carefully balanced against the risks of bleeding from ITP. Treatment decisions may differ depending on whether the patient is COVID-19 negative or positive.

First-line therapy for COVID-19 negative patients

Standard first-line therapy for the management of new or relapsed acute ITP is prednisolone, given at a dose of 1 mg/kg (max 80 mg) for 2 weeks, and thereafter tapered off: slowly if there is a good response, rapidly if treatment is ineffective.
26

There are few data to indicate whether steroids pose a higher risk of the development of COVID-19 infection or worsening symptoms once infected. However, current guidance from the WHO is to avoid steroids if there are alternative treatment options.
35
In patients who are negative for COVID-19 infection, using thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as first-line therapy may be the preferred option. This use is off-label, and local funding may need to be sought through the COVID-19 Interim Measures scheme. One should be mindful that TPO-RAs can take 7-14 days before an effect is seen, and if urgent platelet elevation is needed, intravenous immunoglobulin may be required.

First-line therapy for COVID-19 positive patients

For patients who are COVID-19 positive, the treatment dilemma is even more pronounced. A concern with the use of TPO-RAs for initial treatment is the increased thrombotic potential, which might exacerbate thromboembolic risk in a patient with COVID-19. A recent
in vitro
study of samples from 26 patients showed that those with ITP (not in the context of COVID-19) had increased microvesicle-associated thrombin generation 2 weeks after initiation of TPO-RA treatment compared with controls and pre-treatment levels.
10

Systematic review of trials examining clinical thromboembolic events has found higher rates in patients on TPO-RAs compared with controls,
5
and a long-term clinical study of eltrombopag showed 6% of patients developed arterial or venous thrombosis.
34
There are similar findings with romiplostim, but direct comparison with placebo showed no increase in thrombotic risk;
6
,
18
however, as expected, risk of thrombosis increases with age.
18

Additionally, hepatobiliary events have been found to occur in 15% of patients on eltrombopag,
34
and the drug carries a black box warning for risk for hepatotoxicity. Although clinically significant liver injury has reportedly been uncommon in COVID-19,
4
liver enzymes are usually elevated and the required monitoring of liver function tests throughout treatment with eltrombopag
25
,
27
would be complicated.

Although there are no data on the use of TPO-RAs in COVID-19 positive patients, the risk of hepatotoxicity and the potential for increased thrombosis should prompt caution with their use in this setting, and standard treatment with steroids may be the preferred option for initial treatment. There is concern about potentially higher risks of mortality and secondary infection, which were seen in a systematic review of observational studies of corticosteroids in patients with influenza; however, most of the included studies reported on patients receiving high steroid doses (>40 mg methylprednisolone per day) and the evidence was judged as very low to low quality, owing to confounding by indication.
19
Another study that addressed this limitation by adjusting for time-varying confounders found no effect on mortality.
8
Finally, a recent study of patients receiving corticosteroids for MERS used a similar statistical approach; it found no effect of corticosteroids on mortality but delayed clearance of MERS-CoV from the lower respiratory tract.
2

Thus, whilst further evidence is awaited, steroids may be the better option for COVID-19 positive patients presenting with new or relapsed ITP; however, the dose and duration of treatment should be kept to the minimum necessary. Starting doses of 20mg daily (regardless of patient's weight) may be considered in non-bleeding patients, and increasing after 3-5 days if there is no response. Long courses of steroids should be avoided, and the usual recommendation of tapering after 2 weeks should be adhered to.

Intravenous immunoglobulin

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) may be necessary if immediate elevation of the platelet count is required to control bleeding; although this cannot be relied upon, as indicated in a recent case report of ITP occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.
38
IvIg may also be used as second-line treatment if there is failure to respond to steroids. However, administration requires hospital attendance, supply is short and, whilst clinical complications are rare, they can be significant.
29

The role IvIg may play in the management of patients with severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. A small retrospective study from Wuhan suggested that initiation of IvIg as adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia within 48 h of admission to intensive care may reduce the use of mechanical ventilation and promote earlier recovery of patients.
36
In the absence of adequate titres of neutralizing antibodies, standard IvIg is unlikely to have a biologic effect on COVID-19. Preparations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are being developed, but currently routine use of IvIg from COVID-19 patients is not recommended.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis and, while it is contraindicated in frank DIC, the COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) does not fulfil the ISTH criteria for DIC. However, localised fibrin thrombi occur in the alveolar capillaries and small vessels in association with inflammation and alveolar damage,
9
and endogenous fibrinolysis breaking down the disseminated thrombi could theoretically aid recovery from this. Therefore, in a bleeding patient with COVID-19, judgement should be made regarding the balance of risks associated with bleeding and thrombosis. If TXA is used, the duration of treatment should be kept to the minimum necessary. For oral bleeding, TXA mouthwashes can be given to rinse and spit out.

Interestingly, a recent report in
Physiological Reviews
proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on COVID-19 by cleaving a newly-inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus, resulting in increased infectivity and virulence.
15
Blunting of this response with TXA has been postulated to reduce infectivity of the virus, and an exploratory, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II clinical trial is being established.
23

Immunosuppressant drugs

There is concern that patients on immunosuppressant drugs may be at high risk of developing COVID-19, and/or the disease becoming more severe. However, unlike common viral agents such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, norovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses have not been shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients.
7
Preliminary experience with patients on disease-modifying agents for chronic arthritis and other immune-mediated inflammatory disease is that they do not seem to be at increased risk of respiratory or life-threatening complications from COVID-19 compared to the general population.
12
,
22
Perhaps this is not unsurprising, as the severe complications caused by this family of viruses are driven by the aberrant inflammatory and cytokine response perpetuated by the host immune system. Rituximab is responsible for long-lasting B cell depletion and potentially severe infectious events, and the impact of the drug on the infection risk of COVID-19 is not clear. Furthermore, it can decrease formation of
de novo
antibodies. Until further information becomes available, it may be prudent to avoid immunosuppressant agents and rituximab in new or relapsed patients during the COVID-19 pandemic if possible.

Platelet transfusions

Platelet transfusions are not usually necessary or helpful and should not be routinely offered to thrombocytopenic COVID-19 patients with no bleeding. They may exacerbate a prothrombotic state in COVID-19 positive patients with coagulopathy, and in patients with immune thrombocytopenia they are likely to be consumed too quickly to be of value. Platelet transfusions should only be given if it is considered that haemorrhage is life-threatening or in a critical site such as the eyes.

Recommendation

There is little evidence to inform the optimal management of a patient presenting with new or relapsed acute ITP.

In patients who are negative for COVID-19, TPO-RAs may be preferred as first-line treatment in order to avoid corticosteroids, which may increase risk of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic.

In patients who are positive for COVID-19, TPO-RAs may potentially increase the thrombotic complications, and identifying eltrombopag hepatotoxicity may be difficult.

If steroids are used as first-line therapy, the dose and duration should be kept to the minimum necessary.

A starting dose of 20 mg daily may be considered in non-bleeding patients, with increase to 1 mg/kg after 3-5 days if there has been no response.

Steroid doses should be tapered after 2 weeks--slowly if there has been good response, rapidly if there is no response.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg) may be necessary if immediate elevation of the platelet count is required to control bleeding. It may also be used as second-line treatment if there is failure to respond to steroids.

Tranexamic acid in COVID-19 infected patients should be used as required for the management of bleeding in ITP patients, but avoided in those with frank DIC.

Platelet transfusions should only be given if bleeding is thought to be life threatening, or at a critical site.

Management of chronic ITP

Management of patients with chronic stable ITP should not alter because of the pandemic; patients should remain on their current medication, even if this includes steroids and immunosuppressants. However, attention to isolation procedures is crucial. The British Society for Rheumatology provides helpful guidance on shielding measures for patients on immunosuppressants (Fig
1
).

Patients with splenectomy are probably not at increased risk of COVID-19 infection but are susceptible to bacterial infections and must be vigilant with their prophylactic antibiotics during this time, as well as up to date with their pneumococcal, haemophilus influenza and meningitis vaccinations.

ITP patients not requiring treatment in the last 12 months or on non-immunosuppressive agents such as TPO-RAs are not considered to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and should comply with self-isolation measures as for all individuals in the UK.

Recommendation

Patients with chronic ITP should remain on their usual treatment.

They should be vigilant with self-isolation and shielding measures as appropriate.

Splenectomised patients should be stringent with their antibiotic prophylaxis and up to date with vaccinations.

Regular patient contact should be maintained and appointments conducted by telephone or online platforms.

Thrombotic risk associated with ITP

ITP is associated with a mild elevation in thrombotic risk, with a cumulative incidence of 3*2% (95% CI, 2*0-5*0) for arterial and 1*4% (95% CI, 0*8-2*5) for venous thrombosis at 5 years.
28
Risk may be slightly heightened by treatment-related factors such as splenectomy and TPO RAs, and is higher where there are associated antiphospholipid antibodies. It is unknown how this combines with the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 and whether the increment in thrombotic risk is negligible or synergistic.

Venous and arterial thromboembolic complications have been identified in 31% of 182 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in ITU.
16
These were predominantly pulmonary emboli (81%), with at least two thirds involving more than just subsegmental arteries. Deep vein thrombosis was less frequent in this study, although it has been shown to increase with duration of hospitalisation and be significantly higher in ITU patients compared to those not on ITU.
21
Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with CAC;
30
however, in both of the above studies, the patients had been taking prophylactic LMWH, raising the question whether doses should be increased in patients with more severe disease.

LMWH also has anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties which may be of benefit in these patients, but use and dose of LMWH needs to be balanced against the bleeding risk that is seen in some patients with severe COVID-19 infection, even without thrombocytopenia.
33
LMWH may need to be avoided if platelets are <30 x 10
9
/l
14
and intermittent pneumatic compression used instead. The LMWH should be recommenced once the platelet count can be raised above this threshold. Regular assessment of both bleeding and thrombotic risk is essential throughout the course of the hospital stay and upon discharge.

Recommendation

One should be mindful of a potential further increase in thrombotic risk in patients with COVID-19 from ITP or its treatment.

ITP patients hospitalised with COVID-19, whose platelets are <30 x 10
9
/l and for whom LMWH is considered unsafe, should have intermittent pneumatic compression until LMWH can be restarted.

Regular assessment of both bleeding and thrombotic risk should be made throughout the course of the hospital stay and on discharge.

Patient information

This is an anxious time for everyone, not least for those with autoimmune diseases. Contact with patients is important along with reassurance that services will continue as normal; however, outpatient appointments should be conducted by telephone or online platforms wherever possible. Arrangements for blood tests and safe pick-up or delivery of medications should be made clear.

They should be provided with information regarding self-isolation procedures/shielding (Fig
1
), mental well-being maintenance, and who to contact if they are feeling unwell with fever and cough or are having difficulty breathing.

They should also be made aware that COVID-19, like all viral infections, may cause a relapse of their ITP, and be informed who to contact if they think their platelet count has dropped or if they experience bleeding or unusual bruising.

Recommendation

Hospital attendance should be kept to the minimum necessary, with outpatient appointments conducted by telephone or online platforms where possible.

Patients should be provided with information regarding self-isolation and shielding procedures and given contact arrangements for COVID-19-related symptoms or suspected ITP relapse.

Abstract

For the past 150 years, platelets have been recognized as the major blood component that mediates hemostasis and thrombosis. In more recent years, however, we have come to appreciate that platelets also perform profound immune functions during infection with various pathogens. We now recognize that platelets can also mediate a response to various RNA viruses such as influenza and that many viral infections, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can affect platelet count. Thrombocytopenia and increased coagulation have been independently associated with increased mortality. This article provides a perspective on the potential roles of platelets during COVID-19.

Patients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications. Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population. However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization. Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency. Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.

Abstract

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that currently lacks standardized and established laboratory markers to evaluate its severity. In COVID-19 patients, the number of platelets (PLTs) and dynamic changes of PLT-related parameters are currently a concern. The present paper discusses the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19. Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs. Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender. Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus2, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) induced pneumonia, emerged in the Hubei region of China and led to an exponential outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Since February 2020, the disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was also identified in Italy and Europe, with increasing incidence in all European countries, and in all continents, with the exception of Antarctica. On March 11, 2020, the WHO formally declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [
1
] and to date, the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 1,864,629 2,811,891 with more than 115,286 197,162 COVID-19-related deaths (04/1325/2020; COVID-19 Dashboard by the CSSE at JHU). Morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 have been prevalently linked to elderly age, gender (male), and preexisting co-morbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), leading to a poorer outcome to the viral infection for frail patients and more often resulting in hospitalization, intensive care unit admittance, and need for invasive tracheal intubation [
2
-
7
]. The mechanisms for high morbidity and mortality in these patients are currently unknown. Despite the fact that clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 are well described and range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection, generally associated by fever (82%) and cough (81%), to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, few and sometimes contradictory laboratory results are being reported, thus impacting the setup of patient prognosis, therapy, and follow-up [
8
,
9
]. On April 13, 2020, 3814 articles related to COVID-19 were published on PubMed/Medline and most of them reported specific hematologic parameters strongly related to severe COVID-19 patients. The main reported parameters were low platelets (PLTs) count, low lymphocyte count and percentage, low total protein level, high D-dimer level, high leukocyte count, high C-reactive protein, high creatinine level, high neutrophil count and percentage, high creatine kinase activity, and prolonged prothrombin time [
10
-
21
]. In some cases, these parameters, though normal at the admission of mild cases, worsened with the course of the disease and are found to be in about three-fourths of patients in severe conditions [
8
,
18
]. The worsening of these indices has been related to intensive care unit access and poor prognosis [
22
,
23
].

PLT number and dynamic changes related parameters in COVID-19 patients are currently a concern. Thus, here, we discussed the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19 (
Figure 1
).

Discussion

From studies where hematologic parameters related to severe COVID-19 patients were examined, alterations of specific coagulation index emerged, i.e. high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time and low PLTs count [
10
-
23
]. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs and in other organs [
10
-
23
]. Regarding pulmonary mircothrombosis, the damage to endothelial cells leads to overactivation, aggregation, and retention of PLTs, and the formation of thrombus at the injured site, which may cause PLTs and megakaryocytes to deplete, resulting in decreased PLTs production and increased consumption. This is also in line with several evidences that identify PLTs as dynamic cells that participate in inflammation and prothrombotic responses in many viral infections [
24
]. In fact, hypercoagulability is also an important hallmark of inflammation and several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and IL-8, can affect all coagulation pathways [
24
]. Thus, the blockade of PLTs overactivation and aggregation could reduce the inflammation and the severity of acute respiratory syndrome [
24
]. In this regard, an intriguing aspect is the possible multiple role played by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been recognized to be the receptor for the SARS-CoV syndrome, but which is also involved in the thrombotic process and mainly expressed in the endothelial cells of lungs [
25
,
26
]. Despite the genomic sequence of COVID-19 showing a distinct genome composition than SARS and MERS, the pattern of alteration of the coagulation parameters and hematological changes related to the increased consumption of PLTs and/or the decreased production of PLTs are in common, as well as the formation of thrombus in lungs [
27
]. In fact, similarly to COVID-19 patients, several retrospective analyses of SARS infected patients showed the occurrence of thrombocytopenia with the lowest PLTs count in about 40-50% of infected patients [
28
,
29
]. As for COVID-19 patients, the presence of thrombi has been recognized in pulmonary, bronchial, and small lung veins of SARS lung autopsies, suggesting a prothrombotic effect also of this virus [
30
,
31
]. Similarly, thrombocytopenia with the lowest PLTs count was also associated with MERS disease in about 37% of patients [
32
,
33
] as well as the presence of microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature [
34
]. However, differently from SARS and MERS, preliminary autopsy studies on COVID-19 patients showed the presence of thrombosis not only in the lungs but also in the portal vein and in other vessels (
https://www.sforl.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WUHAN-Experience.pdf
). It is known that endothelial dysfunction may be associated with expression of endothelial surface adhesion molecules, i.e. the intercellular adhesion molecule, the vascular cell adhesion molecule, E-selectin, and the von Willebrand factor, that play an essential role in the binding of leukocytes, that lead to a local inflammatory response, endothelial cell damage, and subsequent plasma leakage and shock [
35
]. Thus, PLTs, together with endothelial cells and circulating coagulation proteins could also have a role in the development of thrombosis and microthrombosis in organs and tissues other than lungs through their synergistic interaction. However, to date, the effect of COVID-19 infection on PLT-endothelial interactions is almost completely unknown.

In order to thoroughly evaluate these aspects in COVID-19 patients, most advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs should be analyzed because of their importance in the evaluation of the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients. The following parameters linked to PLTs function and activity are, to date, not available in the current literature: PLT fraction, mean volume, distribution width, aggregation, reticulated PLTs, PLT-derived microparticles (PMPs) combined with D-dimer, and a combination of PMPs, PLTs distribution width, PLTs count, and D-dimer. The assessment of these parameters could lead to a great deal of information on the hyper-activation of coagulation and on the development of thrombosis and microthrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Several studies have shown that MPV and immature platelet fraction can be effectively used as markers of PLTs activation and increased risk of thrombosis [
36
-
38
] Larger PLTs contain more dense granules, produce more thromboxane A2, platelet factor A and beta-thromboglobulin, and are consequently more reactive with greater prothrombotic potential than smaller PLTs [
39
]. Moreover, increased immature PLT fraction can predict a decrease in PLT count during coagulopathy [
40
]. A key marker of PLTs activation for COVID-19 patients could also be the PLTs distribution width that has been reported to be increased in venous thrombosis as well as in several hypercoagulative state, such as in cardiovascular diseases [
41
]. An additional PLTs parameter particularly active in thrombus formation is the reticulated PLTs that reflect increased PLTs consumption during the thrombosis progression and/or prelude to the development of thrombosis [
42
]. In fact, reticulated PLTs may reflect an increased PLT turnover in the setting of a normal PLTs count and this aspect could be of critical importance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 [
42
]. Another efficient parameter that can be also combined with PLT distribution width, PLTs count, and D-dimer is the PLT-derived microparticles (PMPs) that play a critical role in thromboembolism through direct cell-to-cell contact interactions or release of active components [
43
]. Once the blood vessels are injured, the PMPs release causes the exposure of collagen and von Willebrand factor thus entailing the adhesion, aggregation, and activation of PLTs [
44
]. Subsequently, factors produced by PLTs, i.e. thromboxane A2 and endothelin, lead to blood vessels contraction, thus supporting thrombogenesis [
45
]. In the meantime, the PMPs membrane proteins accumulated on an anion phospholipid surface can increase the gathering and catalytic activity of tissue factors, thus worsen the blood clotting responses [
46
]. Since this strong procoagulant activity PMPs in combination with PLTs distribution width, PLTs count and D-dimer may be used to increase the sensitivity and specificity in the analysis of the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the alteration of these PLTs parameters in association with the prolonged prothrombin time, increase of D-dimer, and decrease of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients are of key importance to diagnose and/or monitoring the worsening of coagulation. In the most serious form, this worsening of coagulation leads to an inadequate blood supply to different organs and contributing to multiple organ failure/dysfunction, thus giving rise to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) disease [
47
]. This phenomenon, DIC, is in line with what seems to occur in severe COVID-19 patients and was recently described in several studies also using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis diagnostic criteria [
48
-
50
]. DIC is an intricate and multifactorial disease, but several virus-activated events as endothelium exposure, PLTs, and leukocytes damage-associated molecular patterns seem to be the primary actors of DIC pathophysiology [
51
]. Despite, to date, the mechanisms by which PLTs might directly contribute to DIC in COVID-19 patients are unclear, we hypothesize that the strong endothelial cells and PLTs activation induced by COVID-19 stimulate the initiation and propagation of procoagulant pathways and inactivate the natural anticoagulant systems and the endogenous fibrinolysis. These phenomena lead to DIC, thus contributing to multi-organ failure. The therapeutic approaches for these coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients currently start from the classical guidelines related to thromboembolic events and are constantly evolving in light of the evidence emerging on the disease. The daily administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended, especially in some Asiatic countries in which the use of thrombomodulin or antithrombin is not common [
50
,
52
]. Such antithrombotic prophylaxis seems to be quite effective in severe COVID-19 patients, and many authors have underlined that the inflammatory properties of LMWH can have a role in the success of the therapy, in the light of the evidence related to the cytokines storm which characterizes the pathology [
53
]. However, other data suggest caution in the choice of the type of anticoagulant and especially in the administration of increasing doses [
54
]. In addition, in many cases, these therapies require appropriate adjustments to avoid interactions not only with drugs already taken in patients with previous diseases but also with therapies aimed at treating the COVID-19 itself. Just to name a few of the drugs currently being evaluated, bevacizumab can increase adverse thromboembolic events, as opposed to hydroxychloroquine, which can act as an antithrombotic agent [
55
]. These critical aspects highlight the need to detect a safe therapeutic strategy or to adjust it on the basis of patient clinical history and diagnosis. In addition, the absence of an efficacy-proven antiviral treatment led to treat severe COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies from recovery patients, showing a decrease in the major inflammation symptoms and an increase in lymphocytes counts and blood oxygen saturation [
56
-
60
]. The transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) or fresh frozen plasma is also an effective therapeutic strategy for the coagulopathy treatment, including for DIC [
61
]. However, to date, to evaluate if plasma treatment acts directly on the hypercoagulability state present in severe COVID-19 patients additional results and rigorous clinical trials also evaluating the efficacy of plasma not containing SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (plasma from healthy subject) are needed before we may draw definitive effectiveness conclusions on this therapy.

In addition, it is important to underline that, as above reported, severe COVID-19 patients are prevalently those with preexisting comorbidities, as well as elderly and male subjects. All these patients already present impaired PLTs function and activity. It is known that PLTs of elderly and young populations significantly differ in terms of number, activity, and structure: PLTs count in old age is reduced by 35% in men and by 25% in women with respect to early infancy [
62
]. Thus, PLTs count decreases with age, and women have more PLTs than men [
63
]. Furthermore, PLTs from older men and women have a greater sensitivity to aggregation and this characteristic is, however, more pronounced in a pathological state [
62
]. In addition to age and gender, many other environmental and genetic factors, i.e. obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, metastases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influence PLTs aggregation, count, volume, reticulation, and other parameter linked to PLTs activity and structure [
64
-
69
]. Thus, in fragile patients, especially men, where there is an already preexisting alteration of PLTs number and platelet related-parameters, the positivity to COVID-19 could further compromise the PLT functions and activities and this aspect could account the more severe course of the disease. Another aspect that deserves further study is related to full-term pregnant women affected by the disease. Although the vertical transmission is still being evaluated, in some cases of perinatal infection, changes in hematological values have been found, including thrombocytopenia [
70
]. Finally, although the current state of emergency makes these types of follow-ups difficult, it would be interesting to evaluate how long these values return to normal.

Conclusion

The knowledge presented in this communication should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for COVID-19 patients with altered PLTs parameters as well as the need to develop an aggressive treatment for these patients. More information is mandatory in order to evaluate and confirm the hold association between PLTs parameters and COVID-19 patients at different stages of disease development and in a different cohort of patients, considering and stratifying patients for their co-morbidity, age, and gender. Despite the emergency in progress and limited time availability, only the production of strong scientific evidences can avoid the risk of interpretative errors, leading to potential delays in identifying the best care and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients. Increasing our understanding of PLTs functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on diseases pathogenesis, clinical management, therapeutic options, and innovative strategies, but could also lead to the identification of patients at risk of infection and severe disease.

Objectives: To describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with COVID-19 during pregnancy.
Methods: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma.
Results: 16 placentas from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were examined (15 with live birth in the 3rd trimester 1 delivered in the 2nd trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), including abnormal or injured maternal vessels, as well as delayed villous maturation, chorangiosis, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased.
The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma.
Conclusions: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia. These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.

Abstract

This study describes the pathology and clinical information on 20 placentas whose mother tested positive for the novel Coronovirus (2019-nCoV) cases. Ten of the 20 cases showed some evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion or fetal vascular thrombosis. The significance of these findings is unclear and needs further study.

Introduction

With the recent pandemic of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), hospitals can expect an influx of Covid-19 positive patients to labor and delivery. Not surprisingly, little is known about placental findings in such cases, with only 1 report of 3 cases in the world literature.
1
Findings reported were nonspecific, including variable degrees of increased perivillous fibrin and focal increased syncytial knots. One placenta had massive infarction, and a chorangioma was present in another. Using reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), the authors found no evidence of viral nucleic acids in these 3 cases. Recently, a number of Covid-19 positive patients who have delivered newborns have been seen by us. This report catalogs our experience.

Materials and Methods

Placentas received by the Department of Pathology at Weill Cornell Medical Center and consisted of 20 cases. Weill Cornell Institutional Review Board approval was given. Due to the infectious nature of the tissue, fixation for 48 hours was performed prior to dissection. Typical sections were fixed in formalin, processed into paraffin blocks, and stained with usual Hematoxylin and Eosin stain. Clinical information was retrieved from the electronic medical record or surgical pathology accession sheet, which is given in
Table 1
. Testing for Covid-19 was not performed on placental tissue. However, all mothers and infants were tested via RT-PCR at Weill Cornell Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.

Results

All expectant mothers at our institution are tested for Covid-19 even if asymptomatic and all mothers in this study tested positive. Two mothers had a fever on presentation (cases 1 and 2). In case 7, the mother presented with pneumonia and acute hypoxia but was later discharged home. One woman (case 12) was readmitted for hypoxia and shortness of breath 3 days postpartum. No women were admitted to the intensive care unit or intubated. The remaining women were asymptomatic prior to delivery and in the postpartum period. In all cases, the infants had 5-minute Apgars of 8 or 9, were admitted to the well-baby nursery, and discharged home without apparent sequelae. All infants tested negative for Covid-19 by RT-PCR.

Table 2
shows a summary of the pathologic diagnoses.
2
Diagnoses were made and lesions graded as per the Amsterdam criteria.
2
Interestingly, in these first 20 cases, the most common lesion was fetal vascular malperfusion which was seen in 9 cases (45%). In most cases, this was the presence of intramural fibrin deposition in 1 or 2 foci (cases 2, 12, and 13), 2 cases showed only foci of villous stromal-vascular karyorrhexis (cases 3 and 10), while the remaining cases (1, 4, 5, and 7) showed multiple lesions. A few cases showed intramural nonocclusive thrombi which were very recent. In all cases, the fetal vascular malperfusion was low grade (
Figures 1
to
3
). Other miscellaneous findings included meconium macrophages (6 cases), lesions of maternal vascular malperfusion (5 cases), and focal increase in perivillous fibrin deposition. One case (7), in which the patient had pneumonia and acute hypoxia, showed evidence of ascending infection with acute chorioamnionitis and acute funisitis. Four cases showed chronic villitis (8, 13, 17, and 18), which was high grade in 2 cases and was associated with obliterative vasculopathy in 1 case (case 8).

This is another lesion of fetal vascular malperfusion which develops due to thrombosis upstream from the chorionic villi leaving to loss of fetal circulation downstream from the thrombosis. Loss of circulation ultimately leads to loss of fetal vessels with preservation of surface trophoblast. Here, the villi are avascular and the stroma is hyalinized. H&E original magnification 400x.

Discussion

Very little is currently known about the effects of Covid-19 on the human placenta and neonate. The mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus often used as a study model, has been shown to infect the placenta and affect the fetus.
3
Human SARS has been vertically transmitted and in some cases showed fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (fetal vascular malperfusion).
4
In humans, early evidence did not demonstrate vertical transmission of Covid-19 in small cohorts of patients.
5
,
6
However, demonstration of IgM antibodies to Covid-19 in a single neonate, who also had elevated cytokines suggests that vertical transmission is possible, even if uncommon.
7

Covid-19 infection has been associated with hypercoagulability,
8
with development of ischemic changes including gangrene of fingers and toes, with evidence of d-dimer elevation, and, in some patients, with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in one series.
9
Whether the fetal vascular malperfusion in some of the cases described in this study is related to hypercoagulability associated with Covid-19 and whether villitis of unknown etiology is related to an antiviral immune response need further study.

This is a brief report of initial findings seen in placentas of Covid-19 positive mothers. While one of our cases had fetal vascular malperfusion findings potentially related to a furcate cord insertion, in 8 cases there was no gross umbilical cord abnormality known to be associated with fetal vascular malperfusion. This suggests that maternal Covid-19 infection might be associated with propensity for thrombosis in the fetal circulation. This, in turn, may have significant clinical implications for the mother and infant. On the other hand, as the lesions were low grade, more than half did not have thrombotic lesions and the infants tested negative; hence, these findings may be unrelated. Further studies with additional cases are necessary to determine the reproducibility and significance of these initial findings.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), currently a worldwide pandemic, is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The suspected contribution of thrombotic events to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients has prompted a search for novel potential options for preventing COVID-19-associated thrombotic disease. In this article by the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group, we describe novel dosing approaches for commonly used antithrombotic agents (especially heparin-based regimens) and the potential use of less widely used antithrombotic drugs in the absence of confirmed thrombosis. Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated. Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19. Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties. It is our hope that the present document will encourage and stimulate future prospective studies and randomized trials to study the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of these agents for prevention or management of thrombosis in COVID-19.

Limited data are available to determine the antithrombotic therapy to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who do not have confirmed evidence of thrombosis. The optimal dose and agent for thromboprophylaxis remain unknown. Conservative management has merit based on historical data pertaining to critically ill medical patients[
12
] as well as for COVID-19-specific escalation of treatment.[
13
] For interim decision-making, consensus-based guidance has been provided by some groups,[
14
]
[
15
]
[
16
]
[
17
]
[
18
] including the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group[
5
] ([
Table 1
]). However, unlike other extensively studied illnesses such as sepsis,[
19
] a comprehensive assessment of potential options for prevention of thrombosis in various subgroups of patients with COVID-19 has not to date been proposed.

Table 1

Suggested considerations for prevention and management of thrombosis among hospitalized patients with COVID-19[
a
]

Risk stratification for VTE should be performed for all inpatients with COVID-19. In the absence of contraindications, the vast majority of inpatients, including all patients with severe COVID-19 who are critically ill should receive prophylactic anticoagulation

The optimal intensity of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Although prophylactic dosing is most widely used, higher intensity of anticoagulation (including intermediate-dose and full-therapeutic anticoagulation) is being used by many clinicians/institutions. Additional studies are required to identify the optimal regimen in various patient groups with COVID-19

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require therapeutic anticoagulation (for prior indications including AF, VTE, mechanical valves, or new incident events such as new VTE or type I myocardial infarction), presence or absence of DIC, and hepatic and renal function should be considered when determining the appropriate choice of anticoagulant agent and dose[
a
]

Hemostatic derangements, including elevated D-dimer levels, are common among inpatients with COVID-19. The majority of a consensus panel did not find sufficient evidence for routine screening for VTE (e.g., bilateral lower extremity ultrasound, or computed tomography pulmonary angiography) for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, a high clinical index of suspicion for VTE should be maintained and appropriate diagnostic tests should be pursued in case of signs or symptoms for DVT (including unexplained lower extremity pain or swelling) or PE (including unexplained chest pain, unexplained right ventricular dysfunction, or hypoxemia disproportionate to the pulmonary infiltrates)

Risk stratification for VTE should be done for hospitalized patients at the time of discharge. Extended pharmacological prophylaxis (up to 45 d) should be considered for patients at high risk of VTE who do not have a high risk of bleeding

Drug-drug interactions should be considered between investigational COVID-19 therapies and antithrombotic agents

More detailed recommendations are provided in a separate manuscript.[

]

In this article, prepared by the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group, we summarize potential therapeutic options for prevention of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients
in the absence of confirmed thrombotic events
. Our focus is on novel approaches to dosing commonly used antithrombotic agents (heparin-based regimens and direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs]), considerations for empiric use of less widely used antithrombotic drugs such as danaparoid, and the potential applications of antiplatelet agents. In addition to the direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action--including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects--have been postulated.[
20
]
[
21
] Finally, we discuss other therapies, such as immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties. The goal is not to provide immediately actionable management recommendations (as high-quality data to reliably inform such guidance in patients with COVID-19 are lacking), but rather to summarize potential treatment options and their advantages and limitations for ongoing and future investigations. We outline research priorities for these agents across the relevant clinical subgroups.

Methodological Considerations

To provide a thorough assessment for the rationale and potential advantages and limitations of various antithrombotic agents, subcommittees from the collaborative drafted the sections focused on specific agents, and these sections were then reviewed and revised by the entire group. The colead authors searched MEDLINE (with PubMed interface) to ensure that no other high-quality clinical study was missed (date of last search: May 5, 2020).

For research priority setting, a survey was sent to the group of coauthors who were asked to rate the overall priority for investigating each of the discussed agents and to identify the care setting wherein the investigation was most reasonable (outpatients with COVID-19, inpatients on the wards, critically ill patients in the intensive care unit [ICU], or patients posthospital discharge).

Investigational Strategies Targeting Thromboinflammation in COVID-19

In the subsequent sections, we describe various investigational strategies for anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, hemostatic modulating agents, and immunomodulators that may have potential for further investigation for patients with COVID-19 ([
Table 2
]; [
Fig. 1
]). In addition, a summary of the survey results for research priorities with these agents is provided in [
Table 3
] and [
Figs. 2
] and [

# In a retrospective analysis, use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR of 0.86 per day, 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.89,
p
< 0.001) without increased bleeding. The indication for anticoagulation, or the type of treatment were not described. Sufficient information was not provided about the comorbidity profile of the patients (e.g., contraindications to anticoagulation)[
187
]

# Nebulized danaparoid can attenuate coagulation activity in the lungs and systemically as well as reduce levels of pulmonary inflammation. Animal models of lung injury suggest improved survival with its administration[
46
]

# No current evidence for danaparoid in COVID-19

# Heparan sulfate moiety in danaparoid may have antiviral actions and may restore heparan deficit on vascular endothelium

# Given minimal effect on platelets[
40
] and ability to be used in patients with severe renal failure,[
188
] danaparoid may have the potential for use for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19

# There is some evidence to suggest microthrombi in the setting of ARDS and critically ill patients[
189
]

# Urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator have been shown to be protective in murine models and to reduce the risk of ARDS in porcine models[
76
]

# Systemic fibrinolytic therapy has been used off-label in ill patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 with transient improvement in oxygenation and ventilatory requirement.[
70
]
[
71
] No long-term benefits have been established

# Further evaluation of the role of fibrinolytics should be explored

# Further prospectively collected data in this space is needed

# Established risks include major bleeding events (including intracranial hemorrhage); however, further understanding of the risk for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is needed

# While prospective analyses have suggested reduced mortality when used in the prehospital and ICU setting[
97
]
[
98
], these findings were not validated in a randomized trial which evaluated its use for preventing ARDS[
100
]

# No current evidence for aspirin in COVID-19

# There is an ongoing clinical trial assessing DOACs with DAPT, statins, and PPIs in patients with COVID-19 and suspected acute coronary syndrome (NCT04333407)

# A small trial randomized 22 patients to dipyridamole (150 mg orally three times a day) vs. routine control in which the treatment group had higher hospitalization discharge rates compared with the control group (58.4% vs. 20.0%), increased platelet counts, stabilization of D-dimer levels, with trends to suggest faster recovery[
190
]

# No current evidence for the association between use of hydroxychloroquine and thrombosis in COVID-19

# Data from a small case series suggests antiphospholipid antibodies may play a role in development of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19[
193
] Further data are needed to assess whether hydroxychloroquine may have a benefit in COVID-19

Anticoagulants

Unfractionated Heparin and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparins

Unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are the most frequently administered parenteral anticoagulants.[
22
] In addition to their antithrombotic activity, they have postulated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Their anti-inflammatory properties may occur through selectin blockade, inhibition of bradykinin and thrombin generation, and binding of inflammatory cytokines.[
23
]
[
24
] Heparins may also possess antiviral properties. For example, heparin may attenuate viral interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor by binding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.[
25
]

The use of empiric heparin anticoagulation in patients with H1N1 ARDS was associated with reduced risk of thrombotic events without an increase in bleeding complications.[
26
] With this consideration and the concern for breakthrough rates of thrombotic events despite prophylactic anticoagulation,[
7
] several randomized trials evaluating varying intensities of heparin-based anticoagulation, ranging from prophylactic, or weight-adjusted prophylactic dose treatment to intermediate to full-dose therapy are underway (NCT04345848, NCT04344756, NCT04373707, NCT04359277, NCT04367831, NCT04362085, NCT04377997). Additionally, several institutions have implemented protocols to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation empirically, utilizing risk stratification based on an individual's thrombotic and bleeding risk.[
27
]
[
28
] Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the use of these strategies on thrombotic and bleeding complications.

One potential challenge in the use of unfractionated heparin is the utility of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for monitoring heparin. In patients with COVID-19, besides the intensity of heparin-based regimens, substantial heterogeneity in the aPTT response may be driven by high levels of factor VIII and fibrinogen, or the presence of a lupus anticoagulant.[
29
]
[
30
] Consequently, anti-factor Xa levels may need to be measured to ensure that a therapeutic heparin level is achieved.[
31
]

Trials of inhaled heparin for treatment of COVID-19 are being planned to disrupt SARS-CoV-2 and its ACE2 receptor interaction. Docking of the virus to host cells is mediated by the interaction between the spike (S) protein and heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans. This facilitates further binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its cell-surface receptor, ACE2, via the surface unit (S1) of its S protein.[
32
]
[
33
]
[
34
] It is known that heparin can displace surface proteoglycans, and prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells.[
21
]
[
35
] Drug-drug interactions between COVD-19 investigational therapies and antithrombotic agents should be also considered. [
Fig. 3
] provides a graphical summary of potential interactions.

#

Danaparoid

Danaparoid (a mixture of sulfated glycosaminoglycans including heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate) attenuates thrombin generation by catalyzing the inhibition of factor Xa by antithrombin and by inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II.[
36
] Currently, danaparoid is predominantly used in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in several countries other than the United States.

ARDS is associated with dysregulated inflammation and coagulation.[
5
]
[
20
]
[
37
] Patients with ARDS have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as thrombocytopenia,[
38
] renal failure, and bleeding.[
39
] Because of its safety profile in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, its minor effects on platelet function[
40
] (particularly in sepsis), and potential for management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),[
36
]
[
41
] danaparoid appears to be an attractive option for research in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Importantly, however, no reversal agent is available in the setting of bleeding complications.

Thrombi have been noted in the pulmonary arteries and vessels of other organs including the liver and kidneys in patients having died of COVID-19. The presence of these in situ thrombi raises the possibility that widespread endothelial activation in COVID-19 triggers thrombosis.[
42
]
[
43
] In animal models of sepsis, danaparoid reduces cytokine levels and attenuates thrombosis.[
44
]
[
45
] Intra-alveolar deposits of fibrin and activated leukocytes also contribute to the respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Danaparoid can be nebulized and has been shown to attenuate pulmonary coagulopathy, systemic coagulation, pulmonary inflammation, and improve survival in a lung injury model.[
46
] Nebulized danaparoid administration may concentrate its effect on the lungs and decrease the risk of systemic adverse reactions. Although danaparoid is being empirically used in some centers, no published report or registered clinical trials exist for its use in COVID-19.

Other Parenteral Anticoagulants

Parenteral anticoagulants such as bivalirudin, argatroban, and fondaparinux have been studied in management of patients with acute coronary syndromes, VTE, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.[
47
]
[
48
] However, these agents are more expensive than unfractionated heparin or LMWH, and there are limited data about their use in COVID-19.

Vitamin-K Antagonists

Vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs), including warfarin, function by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, which results in the prevention of the recycling of vitamin K epoxide back to its active form.[
49
] The active form of vitamin K is essential for synthesis of clotting factors in the coagulation cascade (e.g., II, VII, IX, and X) and anticoagulant factors (proteins C and S),[
49
] and so VKAs result in reduction of these factors. These drugs are used for treatment of established thrombotic events (e.g., deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) or for prophylaxis in patients with specific indications (e.g., atrial fibrillation and prosthetic mechanical heart valves). However, in the course of COVID-19 there are several challenges with use of VKAs, including drug-drug interactions, and need for international normalized ratio monitoring, as described previously.[
5
] There are currently no active studies evaluating the use of VKAs in COVID-19.

Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Beyond their anticoagulant effects, DOACs, especially factor Xa inhibitors, may exert anti-inflammatory effects in COVID-19.[
50
] As has been demonstrated with rivaroxaban, DOACs can prevent arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with history of acute coronary syndrome,[
51
] stable atherosclerotic vascular disease,[
52
] or peripheral artery disease undergoing revascularization.[
53
] Rivaroxaban and betrixaban reduce the risk of VTE in medically ill patients.[
54
]
[
55
]
[
56
] As such, there is interest in administering DOACs to patients with severe COVID-19. These benefits should be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding events.

DOACs offer the potential for in-hospital and posthospital VTE prophylaxis. Results of studies with DOACs for extended prophylaxis in medically ill patients without COVID-19 have been mixed.[
54
]
[
57
] However, recent investigations in patients who are at high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding (including those with severe infection) have demonstrated a net clinical benefit, especially for extended thromboprophylaxis posthospital discharge with betrixaban or rivaroxaban.[
54
]
[
58
] There is currently one registered clinical trial (C-19-ACS) assessing low-dose rivaroxaban along with dual-antiplatelet therapy, statins, and a proton-pump inhibitor in patients with COVID-19 and a suspected acute coronary syndrome (NCT04333407).

A few centers have integrated DOACs into VTE prophylaxis algorithms for both in-hospital and postdischarge care.[
28
] However, concerns remain about DOAC use in patients with COVID-19-associated complications, including its renal clearance and acute renal insufficiency, need for invasive procedures (e.g., dialysis access), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and difficultly in administering reversal agents.[
59
]
[
60
] Finally, drug-drug interactions need to be considered when using DOACs with some investigational COVID-19 therapies (see [
Fig. 4
]).[
5
] A recent small study showed increased absorption with high drug levels of DOACs in patients with COVID-19 who received antiviral agents.[
61
] DOACs may offer an attractive option to prevent thromboembolic events in the prehospitalization period for high-risk patient groups with COVID-19, such as those with underlying cardiovascular disease or high VTE risk factors. There is at least one planned study with rivaroxaban underway in outpatients with COVID-19 (Prevent HD).

In patients with high suspicious for VTE, diagnosis should be sought when possible. For empiric treatment of select patients in whom presumed VTE events cannot be confirmed during the hospitalization period, for logistical reasons, use of DOACs upon hospital discharge offers additional convenience.[
62
] Challenges with this approach include the uncertainty in the diagnosis of VTE, and that delayed VTE imaging may not have sufficiently high negative predictive value to exclude an earlier event. Some COVID-19 patients will not be candidates for DOACs, such as those with severe renal dysfunction, mechanical heart valves, and antiphospholipid syndrome, or those taking antiviral or immunomodulatory medications that may be associated with drug-drug interactions, and poor medication adherence.

Sulodexide

Sulodexide is an orally administered purified glycosaminoglycan consisting of heparan sulfate (80%) and dermatan sulfate.[
63
] It exerts antithrombotic properties through reduction of fibrinogen[
64
]
[
65
] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)[
64
]
[
66
] and is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties.[
65
]
[
67
]
[
68
] In a recent systematic review of randomized trials across a variety of cardiovascular indications, use of sulodexide compared with control was associated with reduced risk of VTE, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.[
69
] Despite the potential interest, limited data exist about the safety and efficacy of sulodexide in patients with COVID-19 and there are currently no registered trials for sulodexide in these patients.

Fibrinolytic (Thrombolytic) Agents

Systemic Fibrinolytic Therapy

Systemic fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) therapy is approved for management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and high-risk pulmonary embolism. Off-label use has been reported for the treatment of a small number of severely ill patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19.[
70
]
[
71
]
[
72
] While empiric use of fibrinolytic agents is not based on solid clinical evidence and confers significant bleeding risk, there is precedent for its use in ARDS. As with other causes of ARDS, fibrin-rich hyaline membranes have been reported in lung biopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19.[
73
] Additionally, D-dimer, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen levels may all be increased in COVID-19 patients with significant lung involvement,[
74
] suggesting derangement of coagulation. The presence of microthrombi in the pulmonary microcirculation has been implicated as a possible mechanism for clinical deterioration.[
75
]

Fibrinolytic agents such as urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator have reduced the risk of ARDS in porcine models.[
76
] Similarly, lung-protective findings have been noted in murine models.[
77
] A meta-analysis of preclinical studies corroborated these findings in various animal models.[
78
] Anecdotal reports have noted improvement in oxygenation and ventilation parameters.[
79
] A recent small study (
n
= 60) study found improvement in surrogate parameters of ventilation and a reduction in ICU mortality in patients with severe non-COVID-19-related ARDS treated with inhaled streptokinase.[
80
]

The bleeding risks of fibrinolysis must be balanced against these preclinical data and small human series. Systemic fibrinolysis has been associated with a 1 to 3% rate of intracranial hemorrhage and notable risk of other forms of major bleeding across a wide span of acute diseases.[
81
]
[
82
]
[
83
] Additionally, there is concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after fibrinolysis, though reports of this complication have yet to be reported. Prior studies have suggested fibrinolytic agents such as alteplase can be associated with prolonged hypofibrinogenemia.[
84
]

Based on the present evidence utilization of fibrinolysis for COVID-19-associated ARDS, even when severe, cannot uniformly be recommended given its unknown risk-benefit ratio. However, investigational use of fibrinolytic agents in carefully selected patients may be considered. A phase 2a randomized trial is underway to test the hypothesis whether systemic tissue-type plasminogen activator results in an improvement of respiratory function/oxygenation and reduction in mortality (NCT04357730). Further, inhaled fibrinolytic agents are an interesting option, potentially limiting systemic complications.[
85
] Assessment of their safety and efficacy requires further investigation (NCT04356833).

Antiplatelet Agents

Aspirin

Dysregulated immune response and abnormal coagulation are common occurrences in the pathophysiology of viral sepsis, ARDS, and organ failure in COVID-19.[
86
] Platelets play a key role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and thrombosis, and are a potential target for prevention of the complications.[
87
]

In addition to thrombosis and hemostasis, platelets have immunomodulatory activity, including both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as an effect on antimicrobial host defense.[
88
]
[
89
] There is evidence that the initial intrinsic defense against infections is mediated by platelet-neutrophil cross-communication that tightly regulates immune and complement responses.[
88
] These interactions can facilitate a variety of proinflammatory effects such as cytokine release, endothelial cell activation, platelet-leukocyte interaction, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and fibrin/microthrombus formation that while potentially harmful[
90
]
[
91
] can also inhibit macrophage-dependent inflammation and thus may on balance be protective.[
87
]
[
92
]
[
93
]

Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has been extensively studied in ARDS. Aspirin has been associated with ARDS prevention and higher survival rates from acute lung injury in animal models and observational human studies.[
94
]
[
95
]
[
96
]
[
97
]
[
98
]
[
99
] Aspirin has been associated with reduced mortality in the setting of both prehospital use and use in ICU.[
97
]
[
98
] These findings, however, were not validated in a phase 2b randomized clinical trial.[
100
] Some investigators have hypothesized that higher maintenance doses of aspirin (325-650 mg/d) may be required to achieve the desired anti-inflammatory effect in patients with an exuberant immune response.[
101
]
[
102
]

P2Y
12
Receptor Antagonists

The role of P2Y
12
receptor inhibitors has also been described in ARDS and sepsis. Adenosine diphosphate-mediated activation of the P2Y
12
receptor may occur in many inflammatory and immune cell types including platelets, leukocytes, and dendritic cells. Among 224 consecutive patients admitted for community-acquired pneumonia, those receiving antiplatelet agents (aspirin and/or thienopyridines) for at least 6 months had lower use of the ICU and shorter stay in the hospital compared with age-matched controls.[
103
] In a post hoc analysis from the PLATO trial, patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with the potent P2Y
12
inhibitor ticagrelor and aspirin had fewer adverse pulmonary events and sepsis and lower mortality with those events compared with patients treated with the less potent P2Y
12
inhibitor clopidogrel and aspirin.[
104
]

The XANTHIPPE trial (Examining the Effect of Ticagrelor on Platelet Activation, Platelet-Leukocyte Aggregates, and Acute Lung Injury in Pneumonia) was the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate the effect of ticagrelor on inflammation, platelet activation, and lung function in patients with community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia.[
105
] Among 60 randomized patients, ticagrelor administration within 48 hours of pneumonia diagnosis was associated with an anti-inflammatory effect evidenced by reduced platelet-leukocyte aggregates in the circulation, lowered interleukin (IL)-6 levels, and improved lung function with a decrease in supplemental oxygen requirements. However, given the potential bleeding risks, in the absence of phase III trials demonstrating favorable clinical outcomes, these research findings have not translated into routine clinical practice.

With respect to COVID-19 and antiplatelet agents, there are many unknowns as regards their use and utility. First, it is not clear which phase of the disease might best respond. Second, the optimal agent and dose to maximize efficacy while minimizing bleeding risks are unknown. Due to its pleiotropic effects, ticagrelor may have more potent anti-inflammatory and even bactericidal characteristics than other agents.[
106
]
[
107
] Randomized trials evaluating role of aspirin and clopidogrel in COVID-19 patients at increased cardiovascular risk are underway (NCT04333407). Third, antiplatelet therapies may have adverse drug-drug interactions with some investigational COVID-19 therapies such as lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir.[
5
]
[
108
]
[
109
] Fourth, thrombocytopenia (immune-mediated or consumption-related) is associated with increased risk for worse clinical outcomes with COVID-19.[
110
]
[
111
] Finally, the extent to which bleeding risks are increased, particularly in patients with DIC, is unknown.

Dipyridamole

Dipyridamole is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that inhibits platelet aggregation by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate.[
112
] In addition to its well-known antithrombotic properties, dipyridamole may have antiviral effects with proposed activity against influenza in animal models.[
113
] In mouse models of viral pneumonia, dipyridamole administration promoted interferon response and prolonged survival in infected mice. Dipyridamole has antiviral effects in vitro, specifically confirming the affinity of dipyridamole for a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
pro
).[
114
] To date, one study has examined dipyridamole in the treatment of COVID-19; 31 patients with COVID-19 were randomized to dipyridamole (150 mg three times a day for 7 days) versus control. In this small study, those treated with dipyridamole showed trends toward higher cure and hospital discharge rates. Increased platelet counts and decreased D-dimer levels were also noted with dipyridamole treatment, attributed to infection resolution.[
115
] Further high-quality data are needed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic potential of dipyridamole.

Vorapaxar

Vorapaxar is an antiplatelet agent that exerts its antiplatelet activity through antagonism of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.[
116
] In patients with history of myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial disease, vorapaxar has been shown to reduce thrombotic cardiovascular events.[
117
] The main concern associated with vorapaxar is its increased risk of bleeding events and reports of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with a previous history of stroke. PAR-1 is thought to have an important role in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and the link between coagulation, inflammation, and the fibrotic response. As such, investigating vorapaxar in patients with COVID-19 has received some attention.[
50
] However, its terminal half-life of 8 days renders it difficult to use in patients with severe COVID-19. To date, there are no registered randomized trials for use of vorapaxar in patients with COVID-19.

Hemostatic Modulating Agents

Antithrombin

The single-chain glycosaminoglycan antithrombin, which is produced in the liver, is modestly decreased in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.[
118
]
[
119
] Thus, reduced antithrombin may be a potential therapeutic target for patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the b-isoform of antithrombin binds preferentially to vascular heparin sulfate proteoglycans and initiates prostacyclin production and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), resulting in anti-inflammatory effects, which might be further pronounced by the binding of b-antithrombin to receptors on monocytes.[
120
] Limited supporting data exist from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Compared with healthy individuals such patients had lower levels of the natural inhibitors of coagulation and higher levels of PAI-1.

Blood coagulation parameters were investigated in 94 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 49 had ""ordinary,"" 35 had severe, and 10 had critical forms of COVID-19.[
121
] When compared with 40 healthy controls, patients in all three categories of COVID-19 had significantly lower levels of antithrombin, and the three subsets of patients had similar levels (86.0, 85.6, and 82.4%). Nebulized antithrombin has resulted in decreased coagulopathy and inflammation in animal models of lung injury.[
122
]
[
123
]
[
124
] Despite these promising findings, there is to date no clinical evidence to support antithrombin provision to critically ill patients or in those with DIC and COVID-19. In a randomized controlled trial of 2,314 patients with severe sepsis, there was no effect of antithrombin therapy on 28-day mortality.[
125
] Moreover, in a meta-analysis of 3,019 patients included in 11 trials, antithrombin administration in critically ill patients was associated with more bleeding events (relative risk [RR]: 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.84).[
126
]

Thrombomodulin

Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell glycoprotein with potent anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects mediated through activated protein C (APC)-dependent and APC-independent protein C mechanisms. In inflammatory states, thrombomodulin production is downregulated and surface thrombomodulin is cleaved so that there is reduced activation of protein C.[
127
] The role of recombinant thrombomodulin as a potential modifier of clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis has been evaluated in clinical trials.

The SCARLET study (Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin) was a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in 800 patients with objective evidence of bacterial infection, sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and concurrent cardiovascular and/or respiratory dysfunction.[
128
] There was no significant between-group differences in the 28-day primary mortality outcome or other secondary endpoints. A post hoc subgroup analysis in patients with coagulopathy reported a trend for reduced mortality compared with placebo (risk difference -5.40%; 95% CI -1.68% to 12.48%). A subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis suggested lower mortality among patients with (but not in those without) sepsis-induced coagulopathy treated with thrombomodulin (RR: 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98).[
129
] Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of thrombomodulin in patients with severe COVID-19. However, investigational use is warranted in selected subgroups with evidence of coagulopathy.

Activated Protein C

APC can play a key role in reducing the damage caused by wide variety of triggers, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, gastrointestinal inflammation, sepsis, and Ebola virus infection.[
130
] In 2002, recombinant human protein C was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the clinical treatment of severe sepsis and ARDS. Protein C concentrates reduced the risk of mortality in early studies of sepsis and septic shock. However, subsequent clinical trials have reported neutral results.[
19
] Specifically, a randomized trial of 1,697 patients did not demonstrate a reduction in mortality at 28 or 90 days after APC was administered in the setting of septic shock,[
131
] and subsequent concerns emerged regarding the risk of serious bleeding and death in individuals with bleeding precautions.[
132
] A possible explanation is that APC may only benefit septic patients complicated by DIC, which was a minority of patients in these trials.

In a study of 27 patients with ARDS (16 treated with recombinant APC and 11 with placebo), the infusion of recombinant APC increased APC levels in the pulmonary compartment and attenuated systemic coagulopathy and pulmonary coagulopathy, providing faster resolution of pulmonary dysfunction without bleeding complications.[
133
] However, in a subsequent randomized controlled trial of 71 patients, infusion of recombinant APC for infectious or inflammatory ARDS did not improve alveolocapillary permeability nor the clinical course of ARDS patients.[
134
]

It is intuitive that protein C concentrates may be more beneficial in patients with significant protein C reduction. However, in a small study of 11 critically ill COVID-19 patients, protein C levels were overall increased, with only 4 patients having a protein C level lower than normal.[
119
] The protein C mutant, 3K3A-APC, being developed for acute stroke treatment, was engineered to have low anticoagulant activity (so low bleeding risk) while retaining APCs' anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective cell signaling properties that may be important in pneumonia. The potential utility of recombinant APC or 3K3A-APC in patients with COVID-19, including those with DIC, is worthy of prospective investigation.[
135
]

Contact Activation System

Dysregulation of inflammation and coagulation are hallmarks of COVID-19. The contact activation system, which includes factor XII, factor XI, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and prekallikrein, links inflammation and coagulation by triggering the generation of thrombin and bradykinin. Thrombin promotes clot formation and platelet activation, whereas bradykinin induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines.

Anti-Inflammatory Agents

Corticosteroids

There is conflicting evidence for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS.[
143
] Postulated benefits, including reduction in inflammation and lung injury, must be weighed against the potential risks of delayed viral clearance and increased susceptibility to secondary infections.[
144
]
[
145
]
[
146
]
[
147
]

Mechanisms as to whether corticosteroids may modulate thrombotic risk in this patient population are not well-established. As the microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic complications observed in COVID-19 may in part be attributable to the inflammatory environment precipitated by the infection, corticosteroids may reduce thrombotic risk through anti-inflammatory activity. Studies of inflammatory states, particularly rheumatologic conditions, have shown a proportional relationship between inflammatory activity, coagulability, and the risk of VTE. Results regarding frequency of thrombosis with disease-modifying therapies, including corticosteroids, are mixed.[
148
]
[
149
] Possible beneficial[
150
] mechanisms include reductions in levels of procoagulant factors, including fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor.[
151
] However, experimental studies have also linked steroid use to increased levels of various clotting factors, and several large-scale studies have shown exogenous glucocorticoids to be a risk factor for thrombosis.[
150
]
[
151
]
[
152
] Prior studies of corticosteroids in patients with non-COVID-19-related ARDS have shown mixed results with potential benefit limited to only certain subgroups of patients.[
153
] Further experience and research, including results from a series of ongoing randomized trials, are needed to better understand the balance of pro- and anticoagulant properties of glucocorticoids in the setting of COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline that has an immunomodulatory effect and antithrombotic activity that have been demonstrated in animal models and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and antiphospholipid syndrome.[
154
]
[
155
]
[
156
]
[
157
]

In a mouse model, hydroxychloroquine reversed the thrombogenic properties of antiphospholipid antibodies.[
158
] Hydroxychloroquine may also have mild antiplatelet effects in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, and may reduce blood viscosity.[
154
] An observational prospective study of patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily demonstrated significant reduction in soluble tissue factor levels at 3 months compared with baseline.[
159
] Other potential antithrombotic mechanisms have led to its limited evaluation as a thromboprophylaxis modality in postoperative patients more than three decades ago.[
160
]
[
161
] However, the exact mechanisms by which it exerts it antithrombotic effect remain largely unknown. Given the known adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine, including QTc prolongation and risk of arrhythmias,[
162
] its routine use as an antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend until further prospective data emerge.

Statins

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used as cholesterol-lowering medications in patients with or at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.[
163
] The pleiotropic effects of statins include improving endothelial function, decreasing inflammatory markers, and inhibiting thrombogenicity.[
164
] Because patients with COVID-19 may exhibit increased activation of the inflammatory cascade and are prone to venous and arterial thrombosis, leveraging statins as a component of treatment has been proposed.[
5
]
[
165
]
[
166
]

While no clinical studies have evaluated statin therapy in the management of COVID-19, there is biological plausibility and precedent for such investigation. Through inhibition of the MYD88 stress-response pathway, statins suppress NF-kB-induced proinflammatory cytokines.[
167
] This may underlie their proposed utility in other viral pneumonias, including those caused by related coronaviruses.[
168
]
[
169
]
[
170
] Besides mitigating inflammation, antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties can occur via downregulation of tissue factor, upregulation of thrombomodulin, and inhibition of thromboxane A
2
.[
171
] Prior reports have shown that use of statins is associated with reduced rates of VTE, and statins have stabilizing effects on atherosclerotic plaques.[
172
]
[
173
] At least three clinical trials (NCT04348695, NCT04333407, and NCT04343001) are recruiting COVID-19 patients in randomized statin investigations.

One potential target is the complement cascade. A major component of innate immunity, the complement cascade has three independent pathways for activation (classical, lectin, and alternative), each culminating with formation of the lytic membrane attack complex. Eculizumab is an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement activity. One of its clinical applications is complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, namely atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is thought to occur in some patients with COVID-19.[
20
]
[
175
] In one study of five COVID-19 nonsurvivors, there was evidence of systemic activation of the alternative and lectin-based complement pathways and deposition of the membrane attack complex in both lung and skin.[
175
]

Based on these data and evidence of efficacy of complement inhibition in murine models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the use of eculizumab in COVID-19 has been proposed.[
20
]
[
175
] Potential barriers include a 1,000 to 2,000 times increased risk of meningococcal disease (requiring prior vaccination or antibiotic prophylaxis) and cost ($20,000-$25,000 per dose).

The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway is another potential therapeutic target. JAK inhibitors target cytokine signaling pathways and have thus been proposed as a candidate to treat COVID-19. Baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, mitigates the systemic inflammatory response and has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 through its numb-associated kinase inhibition that has a high affinity for AAK1, a regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.[
176
] Notably, this therapy does carry a FDA warning for an increased incidence of VTE (6/997 patients with baricitinib vs. 0/1,070 controls),[
177
] and recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines recommends against the use of baricitinib outside of a clinical trial, such as the NIH-sponsored ACTT-2 trial comparing remdesivir +- baricitinib.[
178
] Ruxolitinib is a JAK2 inhibitor approved for patients with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Similar to baricitinib (NCT04340232, NCT04320277, and NCT04346147), ruxolitinib is presently under investigation as a treatment for COVID-19 (NCT04334044, NCT04348071, NCT04337359, NCT04331665, NCT04348695, and NCT04338958).

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome associated with chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, is included in the Chinese National Health commission guidelines for treating COVID-19. While findings are yet to be published, a randomized trial of 129 hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia suggested that tocilizumab administration may significantly reduce rates of death or life support interventions.[
179
] It is thought that tocilizumab may mitigate the proatherothrombotic profile associated with rheumatoid arthritis. However, no specific data related to use of tocilizumab and VTE events in patients with COVID-19 have been published.

Future Directions and Conclusion

Despite the efforts of the international medical and scientific communities and recent declines in hospitalizations, COVID-19 continues to pose an unprecedented challenge. The prognosis for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in the setting of critical illness, continues to be poor.[
180
]
[
181
] While contributing factors to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 are likely multifactorial, thrombotic complications play a major role in the prognosis of these patients.[
5
] The development of safe and effective thromboprophylaxis and treatment strategies for thrombotic disease is contingent on an improved understanding of the mechanistic and pathophysiologic basis for such complications in COVID-19 patients. In this document, we have outlined several agents and mechanisms of action for potential for use as antithrombotic agents in the setting of COVID-19. Survey results from group of authors may be helpful for research priority settings for various agents and patient subgroups with COVID-19 ([
Table 3
]). High-quality research investigations into the optimal drug, dose, and duration of therapies to prevent and treat thrombotic complications of COVID-19 offer the potential to improve outcomes of infected patients."

Background

Objective

To describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.

Methods

An international dermatology registry was circulated to healthcare providers worldwide through the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), International League of Dermatologic Societies (ILDS), and other organizations.

Results

We documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19. Of 318 cases confirmed or suspected as COVID-19 by providers, twenty-three cases (7%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 20 others (6%) were close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Given current testing criteria, many patients lacked COVID-19 testing access. For 55% of patients, pernio-like lesions were their only symptom. In patients with other COVID-19 symptoms, pernio-like lesions typically appeared after other symptoms. Pernio-like lesions lasted a median of 14 days (IQR 10-21).

Limitations

A case series cannot estimate population level incidence or prevalence. Additionally, there may be confirmation bias in reporting. We cannot exclude an epiphenomenon.

Conclusions

Pernio-like skin changes of the feet and hands, without another explanation, may suggest COVID-19 infection and should prompt confirmatory testing.

Background:
The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented strain on health care resources in
The United States. Initial reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) rates from Wuhan, China
ranged between 3-9%, though rates as high as 15% have been reported1, 2. For AKI
requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), intermittent hemodialysis (HD) or
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have been mainstays of therapy in The
United States. However, shortages in supplies, staffing, and available equipment
among critically ill COVID-19 patients particularly in the New York City area has
demanded alternative strategies such as acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment for
AKI (AKI-PD) that are being implemented. Here we will review the rationale for the use
of AKI-PD, describe potential advantages, criteria for patient selection, and practical
considerations based on initial experiences to consider when prescribing and delivering
PD.
Rationale for Acute Peritoneal Dialysis in COVID-19 Patients and Potential
Advantages:
PD was routine for AKI treatment worldwide well into the 1980s. However, by the 1990s
with the development of the central venous catheter for HD, and advent of CRRT, PD
became rarely used in higher resource countries to treat adult patients with AKI3. The
utility and efficacy of PD to treat patients with AKI was reexamined after the publication
of a series of articles from Brazil, including a randomized trial, demonstrating that PD
provided acceptable care and was not inferior to daily HD in treating acutely ill patients
2
with AKI in terms of patient mortality and was associated with a shorter duration of AKI
and need for renal replacement therapy 4, 5. These findings were confirmed in a
randomized trial from Saudi Arabia comparing PD to hemodiafiltration6. AKI-PD
expanded dramatically in lower resource countries with the advent of the Saving Young
Lives Program in 2012 which promoted the use of PD because of minimal infrastructural
requirements, including a lack of need for water or electricity, the ease of training staff,
and low costs. 7-10 With the expanded PD-use, The International Society for Peritoneal
Dialysis (ISPD) developed guidelines for the use of PD to treat patients with AKI.3 The
recommendation that PD was an acceptable form of RRT for AKI in these guidelines
was supported by two meta-analyses (including a Cochrane analysis) both of which
concluded that PD is not inferior to extracorporeal therapies in the management of
patients with AKI11, 12.
As PD is the original continuous renal replacement therapy, it may be particularly
suitable for hemodynamically unstable patients and for those who face challenges in
establishing a reliable vascular access or those with limited vascular access sites.
Furthermore, unlike HD therapies, there are no concerns regarding the need for
systemic anticoagulation. Emerging issues regarding a hypercoagulable state in
critically ill COVID-19 patients may pose challenges in the consistent delivery of HD or
CRRT with repeated dialysis circuit clotting making PD an attractive strategy13. If
automated acute PD prescriptions are delivered, there is a potential for reducing nursing
contact with COVID-19 patients during treatment compared to HD treatments
particularly with the use of extension tubing that allows the PD cycler and
troubleshooting to take place at a distance from the patient. A recent review
3
underscores the utility of PD to manage patients with AKI in austere environments and
under conditions of duress and conflict, emphasizing the ease of implementing
treatment with acceptable outcomes14.
Concerns Regarding Acute PD and Patient Selection:
At the start of PD, solute transport characteristics and ultrafiltration (UF) capacity
remain unknown which may necessitate aggressive initial empiric prescriptions with
more frequent exchanges using hypertonic dialysate to maximize peritoneal
ultrafiltration. This is germane to COVID-19 patients where greater initial fluid removal
may be often warranted15. Unlike HD or CRRT where fluid removal rates are visible in
real time, UF often remains unknown until the end of a PD treatment providing an
additional source of unease among critical care team members. Maintaining enough
solute clearance is an additional concern particularly among hypercatabolic patients but
using high volume PD seems to be able to mitigate these concerns and may be the
preferable modality particularly in mechanically ventilated patients5. Among experienced
centers and using appropriate PD catheter placement techniques (discussed below)
starting dwell volumes of 2.0 L have been used as suggested by The ISPD to allow for
higher earlier PD doses3, 5 . Programs with limited experience in PD-AKI or an operator
new to percutaneous PD access insertion (as may be the case with the experience
during the COVID-19 pandemic in The United States) may first wish to have an initial
test period using lower PD dwell volumes to start.
4
In general, lack of knowledge and familiarity with the performance of PD exchanges and
use of automated PD by critical care nursing staff remains a major barrier. Online or
virtual education and training support from centers with expertise may help overcome
these immediate challenges. In particular, pediatric nurses may be an excellent
resource given the greater use of PD in children. Under extreme cases, attending
nephrologists have resorted to learning to set up the APD cycler for their patients with
adjunct offsite nursing support. Arguably, among staff with no acute dialysis expertise,
training for acute PD is likely more straightforward than is de-novo training in HD or
CRRT delivery and consideration should be given as such. Similar to CRRT, potassium
removal is slower and less efficient and acute PD may not be an initial option for
patients with life threatening hyperkalemia.
A list of potential absolute and relative contraindications for acute PD are listed in Table
1. Of special note in COVID-19 patients is concerns of use of acute PD in
mechanically ventilated patients which is not a contraindication to acute PD. The
primary concern is that increases in intrabdominal pressure (IAP) via PD fluid
installation may theoretically limit diaphragmatic excursion on compromise respiratory
biomechanics. Non-invasive measurement of intraperitoneal pressure has been
described once the PD catheter is in place with typical values ranging from 10-16 cm
H 2 O. Pressures should not exceed 18cm H 2 O and can be lowered by lowering
exchange dwell volumes 16, 17. Yet despite these concerns, initial reports suggest that
despite modest increases in intraabdominal pressure, compared to HD, PD has a
minimal impact on respiratory biomechanics in mechanically ventilated patients even at
dwell volumes of 2L18, 19. Given that many patients with COVID-19 require prone
5
mechanical ventilation (although there are some reports of success PD in prone
ventilated patients), we would suggest an alternative dialysis modality for these patients
be considered due to practical considerations and in individuals with severe respiratory
distress where increases in IAP may potentially accelerate the need for intubation 20, 21.
In AKI-PD, the time between PD catheter placement and initial use is short and PD fluid
leaks represent a complication seen with higher frequency compared to elective PD
starts which usually have at least two weeks of healing time from catheter insertion to
first use22, 23. Nevertheless, the leak rates in the Brazilian and Saudi experience using
high volume PD therapy immediately after catheter placement was extremely low5, 6.
Other patient-related leak risk factors include patients with diabetes, increased body
mass index and patients on chronic immunosuppression24. Strategies to minimize the
risk of leaks include: 1. Selection of initial acute PD candidates with few/no patient-
related leak risk factors 2. Optimization of PD catheter insertion techniques to reduce
the risk of leaks (discussed below), 3. Lower initial dwell volumes in the supine position
(particularly in an initial AKI-PD experience) to reduce intraabdominal pressure25 4.
Using PD as a bridge therapy from another dialysis modality and placing the catheter
early in anticipation of a switch to PD to allow for a longer healing period
PD Access Placement:
In acute PD, similar to urgent start PD, use of the catheter within 24-48 hours demands
optimal placement technique to maximize a successful exchange and minimize the risk
of leaks and allow for rapid escalation in dwell volumes. In the United States, PD
6
access is predominantly provided by surgeons utilizing a laparoscopic approach.26 Due
to considerations of preservation of hospital resources for the anticipated surge of
COVID-19 patients and for the safety of the operating room team performing
laparoscopic procedures, PD access has become difficult to arrange despite Centre for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) designation of dialysis access procedures as
essential27, 28.
Therefore, percutaneous catheter insertion with or without image guidance may be
considered for peritoneal access29, 30. Although experience with percutaneous
placement is not as widespread, it is a technique that can be performed at bedside or in
the radiology suite by surgeons, interventional radiologists, or interventional
nephrologists who have learnt these techniques for the first time during the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, many surgeons have also reverted to bedside mini-laparotomy
procedures for PD access insertion performing these for the first time who would have
traditionally performed these procedures laparoscopically. During access placement,
leak risk is minimized performing the following: 1) Use of a purse-string suture to secure
the deep cuff which should be placed in the rectus muscle31 2) a paramedian over a
midline incision into the peritoneal cavity may further reduce leak risk by providing better
adherence of the deep cuff to the lateral rectus muscle laterally compared to the thinner
medial tissues of the linea alba, though this remains controversial32. For all procedures,
prophylactic antibiotics at the time of PD access insertion should be used in keeping
with ISPD guidelines to reduce early peritonitis risk33. Local expertise and operator
experience with the technique being considered should be the main drivers for the
method of PD access insertion. One of the main advantages for acute PD is that the PD
7
catheter may also serve as a long-term access should the patient fail to recover from
the AKI episode.
Acute PD Protocol and Prescription Considerations:
An acute PD prescription must carefully balance the metabolic and UF needs of the
patient, while minimizing the risk of treatment-related complications. What dose to be
delivered is controversial and has been poorly studied. The Brazilians targeted daily
Kt/V of approximately 0.6 per day, which may be necessary in very catabolic patients,
but the ISPD has suggested that daily KT/V urea of 0.3 may be adequate for many
patients with AKI3, 5. A dose estimation guide is provided in Table 2 though Kt/V urea in
PD may not be the appropriate metric for the dose of dialysis in AKI . Furthermore,
consideration must be given to local resources available including nursing capability and
familiarity with both manual and automated PD, cycler supply, dialysate supply and
nephrologists' ability to identify and manage complications.
A sample PD prescription and protocol are provided in Figure 1. Bowel hygiene is
important to optimize catheter function with a bowel routine protocol in place from the
time of placement and over the course of therapy. Both automated and manual PD
exchanges are possible with an acute PD prescription in the supine position to
minimize the risk of increased IAP and leaks. If manual exchanges are performed,
continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) systems can be used with standard equipment or
using the manifold and clamps to minimize the number of connections and
disconnections needed. Automated PD prescriptions need not be necessarily
8
prescribed for overnight treatments alone and may be set up for continuous (24 hour)
treatments and have been largely used for bedbound and mechanically ventilated
patients. In these cases, the PD cycler can be set up for one 24-hour treatment and 60-
240 -minute exchanges used as clinically indicated. With excessively short APD dwell
times and hypertonic dialysate, there is a greater risk of sodium sieving particularly with
hypertonic solutions leading to excessive free water loss (in the absence of sodium
removal) and biochemistry should be reviewed for rises in serum sodium5, 34. With
frequent automated PD cycling: hypokalemia may also ensue necessitating
intraperitoneal and/or intravenous potassium supplementation. More frequent cycling
may also promote a greater risk of APD alarms overnight, and as a result less frequent
cycles and using tidal PD may be advantageous overnight with fewer/no staff available
to troubleshoot these alarms. If a leak develops, temporary cessation of PD may be
needed and has been introduced as early as within 24 hours of rest using lower dwell
volumes. If persistent, catheter replacement may be necessary ensuring the techniques
as described above. Drug dosing in AKI-PD has not been well established in particular
for antimicrobials and could be potentially extrapolated from the CRRT literature. Where
possible antibiotic drug levels should be measured and followed.
For all PD exchanges Intraperitoneal heparin supplementation (500-1000 u/ L) has been
given either prophylactically to prevent intraperitoneal fibrin formation or as needed
based on appearance of effluent fibrin to maintain PD catheter patency. Heparin is too
large to cross the peritoneal membrane so is not contraindicated in patients with
bleeding diatheses but is contraindicated in cases of heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia
(HIT) where intraperitoneal heparin has been reported to elicit an immunologic
9
response35. With sluggish PD catheter function, drain pain, prolonged inflow or outflow
times or with excessive automated PD cycler low drain alarms, tidal PD (leaving a fixed
residual volume of dialysis solution) during each exchange may be required. Spent
dialysis fluid can be discarded with the same precautions as employed for other bodily
fluids (i.e. urine) among COVID-19 positive patients though viral replication of COVID-
19 has been recently identified in PD effluent.36
Conclusions:
PD for AKI is an established RRT with acceptable outcomes in paediatric AKI patients
and in adult patients outside of the United States37. It is our hope that the renewed
interest in the treatment of PD for AKI in adult patients the United States during the
COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by increased proficiency and comfort with
providing and offering this treatment modality and encouraging initial reports. For
programs with established expertise in managing maintenance PD patients or with
expertise in using PD for urgent-starts in the late-referred end stage kidney disease
(ESKD) patient, PD for AKI may be less of a leap compared to programs with little
experience in maintenance PD where such an endeavour may be more challenging and
perhaps ill-advised. In such cases or where there is reluctance among the critical care
team use of urgent start PD in the late referred ESKD patients or greater use of PD in
subacute kidney injury or as a bridging therapy from HD may offload HD and CRRT
resources reserved for critically ill patients. For a PD-AKI program to be successful it will
require a team approach centered around support from the critical care team, tenets of
PD access insertion reliability and speed, nursing expertise, standardization and
10
implementation of protocols and evidence-based practice (where available). Initial
candidates may want to be considered carefully and more restrictively, particularly in
initially choosing lower acuity candidates and from a PD access perspective,
candidates with no prior major abdominal surgery or scarring. If PD is not meeting the
patient's goals for RRT for AKI after two treatments, it is important to swiftly consider an
alternate dialysis modality. As patients are ready for discharge from the hospital with
ongoing AKI requiring RRT, discharge planners will need to work with outpatient dialysis
facilities to transition the patient to outpatient PD. Currently, in the US, few insurance
providers pay for AKI-PD, therefore the case management team will need to be involved
so that coverage can be guaranteed prior to discharge via the health plan or through an
agreement between the hospital and the dialysis provider. This safe transition should
also include an in-home assessment to ensure the patient's long-term success on the
modality after discharge.

Abstract

Accumulating clinical observations suggest pathogenesis beyond viral pneumonia and its secondary consequences in COVID-19 patients. In particular, many patients develop profound hyperinflammation and hypercoagulopathy with disseminated thrombogenesis and thromboembolism, which we observe also in a Swedish COVID-19 intensive care patient cohort. To understand these vascular manifestations, it is important to establish the potential vascular entry point(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, i.e. which vascular cell types express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We present data that ACE2 is specifically and highly expressed in microvascular pericytes, but absent from endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages and fibroblasts. Mice with pericyte ablation show increased expression and release of Von Willebrand Factor from microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that pericytes orchestrate thrombogenic responses in neighboring endothelial cells. Identifying pericytes rather than endothelial cells as the ACE2-expressing cells in the vasculature may explain why hypertension, diabetes and obesity are risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients, as these conditions are characterized by an impaired endothelial barrier function, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to reach and infect the pericytes that are normally shielded from the blood behind an intact endothelial barrier. This novel COVID-19-pericyte hypothesis is testable, offers explanations for some of the most enigmatic and lethal aspects of COVID-19 and calls for further investigations into the possible benefits of preventive anticoagulant therapy.

As COVID-19 disease escalates globally, optimising patient outcome during this catastrophic healthcare crisis is the number one priority. The principles of patient blood management are fundamental strategies to improve patient outcomes and should be given high priority in this crisis situation. The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and healthcare authorities with information regarding how to apply established principles of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, this review considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and specifies important aspects of donor management. We discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID-19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery. In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID-19. Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply-demand and cost-benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

In December 2019, the first reports of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
1
. Over the course of a few months, COVID-19 has spread globally, with more than 2.8 million confirmed cases at the time of writing
2
. This prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic
3
. During times of crisis, clinicians are constantly being pushed to their limits. As numbers of patients with COVID-19 are continuing to increase, new scientific findings need to be integrated into routine clinical practice. However, established evidence-based medical concepts should still be followed when treating patients.

Patient blood management is a multimodal, multidisciplinary approach based on timely application of a bundle of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts aimed at improving the outcome of patients at risk
4
. The three pillars of patient blood management encompass measures to optimise the patient's red cell mass, reduce peri-operative blood loss and enhance anaemia tolerance
5
. In addition, patient blood management implementation results in reduced transfusion rates and lower healthcare costs
6
,
7
. These aspects are crucial for national medical systems during times when resources and funding are limited. The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and healthcare authorities with information on how to apply the principles of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

This article is a focused expert review. The authors used PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for their literature search. No standardised protocol for the literature search was defined.

Impact on blood supply

In most countries around the world, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented healthcare and socio-economic emergency. As a consequence of social restrictions made by governments to fight the spread of COVID-19, the number of blood donations has significantly decreased during the last few weeks. In addition, although to our knowledge there has been no scientifically documented evidence yet of the transmission of COVID-19 infection through transfusion of blood components, the current outbreak has produced a heated debate regarding the safety of blood donations in endemic countries
8
.

Following the indications from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the supply of substances of human origin
9
, most European National Health Competent Authorities have issued some recommendations on the prevention of transmission of COVID-19 infection through transfusion of labile blood components. Beside the recommendation of employing the hospitals' patient blood management-based programmes of blood saving, several actions have been implemented in the setting of blood donor selection.

Specific donor management

The Italian National Blood Centre (Centro Nazionale Sangue, CNS), the Health Ministry's technical and scientific advisory body on matters related to blood and blood products, has issued a number of measures aimed at maintaining high standards of blood donation and blood safety in Italy, one of the countries with a higher incidence of COVID-19-related casualties worldwide
10
:

Strengthen surveillance measures of individuals in contact with subjects with documented COVID-19;

Defer blood donations from donors returning from any national or international territory with a travel health notice for 14 days, donors who have possibly been exposed to the risk of infection by contact with subjects with COVID-19 documented infection, and donors with a history of COVID-19 infection (documented infection or onset of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection) who are convalescent;

Require donors to inform their blood collection centres in case of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection or in the case of diagnosis of COVID-19 infection within 14 days after donation (post-donation information);

Promote the implementation of simple triage processes during the reception of donors at blood collection units, aiming to avoid the possible spread of the virus in waiting rooms. This includes the measurement of body temperature outside the collection area. A body temperature of 37.5degC or higher is defined as a criterion for the temporary deferral of the donor;

Request all personnel working at blood collection units to comply scrupulously with behavioural protocols designed to prevent the spread of respiratory infections, including COVID-19 infection.

Additional actions directed towards the management of voluntary blood donors to ensure continuous and safe donation of blood components include a timely appeal to donate blood when shortage is foreseeable; careful planning of the donor schedule to avoid an excessive number of donors at blood collection centres as well as compliance with social distancing measures; use of adequate personal protective equipment; and meticulous adherence to hygiene regulations. In addition, travel to donate blood should be considered as essential by governments or - if deemed non-essential - provision of a certificate allowing travel to the collection centre should be provided. The application of these recommendations has facilitated the safer management of blood donations and, following an initial 10% decrease in whole blood collection, has maintained a stable volume of total blood donations (approximately 50,000 units per week), thus guaranteeing blood component self-sufficiency and safety in Italy.

Anaemia

In major elective surgery, patients can be exposed to the effects of pre-operative anaemia, blood loss and red cell transfusion, all of which adversely influence postoperative outcome
11
,
12
. In patients undergoing major surgical procedures, it is recommended that pre-operative anaemia be defined by haemoglobin < 130 g.l
-1
, irrespective of sex
13
,
14
. Using this definition, in a large cohort of major elective procedures, the overall prevalence of pre-operative anaemia was 36%. Over 70% of anaemic patients presented with absolute or functional iron deficiency, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis
15
. In addition, pre-operative iron deficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with a three-fold increased 90-day mortality
16
. Non-anaemic haematinic deficiencies are also prevalent and may hamper pre-operative haemoglobin optimisation and/or recovery from postoperative anaemia
5
,
15
. As for non-elective procedures, up to 75% of patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery presented with haemoglobin < 130 g.l
-1
on admission
17
.

These figures could be expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic due to changes in diet and lifestyle, aggravated by a reduced purchasing power and decreased incomes. Possible consequences include: a reduced consumption of fresh food, including fruit and vegetables (vitamin C, folic acid), dairy products (vitamin D), fish and meat (iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B12); and a lack of sunlight exposure and muscle atrophy resulting from curfew restrictions and social distancing. Consequently, proliferation of red cell progenitors, iron homeostasis and haemoglobin synthesis, as well as overall physical and mental performance, could be affected
18
,
19
. Depending on their general health condition and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly are likely to be the most affected
20
. Most importantly, this population has the greatest comorbidity load and represents the largest proportion of hospitalised medical and surgical patients.

Diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients awaiting elective surgery

During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective medical activity is markedly reduced and elective surgery is frequently postponed, with priority given to urgent and emergency surgery. Pre-operative anaemia clinics, which function to screen, diagnose, and treat iron deficiency and other causes of anaemia are mostly closed and appointments cancelled. As a result, blood testing and diagnostic tools are less readily available, hampering the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia of various causes. Remote (telephone or video) consultations are possible and have become much more widespread. It is certainly possible to elicit the most common symptoms of severe iron deficiency: fatigue/exhaustion; brain fog; palpitations, shortness of breath; anxiety; low mood/depression; aching and restless legs; alopecia, brittle/ridged fingernails; and pica (appetite for non-nutritive substances). Patients with these symptoms should be expedited to iron therapy. Iron deficiency anaemia may worsen over time, so early treatment is favoured. Intravenous (i.v.) iron administration is preferred, either via anaemia clinics or through general practitioners as it yields rapid results. However, as administering i.v. iron might not be feasible during the pandemic, oral iron may be the treatment of choice to correct iron deficiency and treat anaemia when non-urgent surgery is delayed and waiting periods are prolonged. Alternate-day treatment with oral iron is recommended, rather than daily doses, to improve uptake and compliance
21
. Newer oral iron formulations with enhanced absorption and gastro-intestinal tolerability, such as sucrosomial iron, should be considered
22
. This line of action is also practicable in individuals who cannot leave their home due to quarantine measures. Once surgery is rescheduled, diagnostic testing for haemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and transferrin saturation should be undertaken during pre-operative assessment.

Diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients admitted for emergency surgery

As stated above, the incidence and severity of anaemia is likely to increase during the pandemic due to changes in diet and lifestyle. Thus, we may experience a greater proportion of patients admitted for urgent or emergency surgery being anaemic. Low ferritin (< 30 ng.ml
-1
) is often used as an indicator of very low iron stores and iron deficiency. However, ferritin is increased during acute phase inflammation as may be seen with viral infections such as COVID-19. Consequently, the use of ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency may be problematic in patients with COVID-19 disease, who may have normal or high ferritin levels despite very low iron stores
23
. Hence, we recommend concurrent measurement of CRP and transferrin saturations. Transferrin saturation < 20% strongly suggests iron deficiency, especially when ferritin is < 100 ng.l
-1
13
. Increased CRP (> 4 mg.l
-1
) indicates that ferritin measurement alone is unreliable due to acute inflammation or viraemia. The bone marrow response to i.v. iron starts early after infusion, with a peak haemoglobin concentration within the following 4-6 weeks
24
. If urgent surgery is necessary in patients with iron deficiency anaemia, i.v. iron should be favoured over oral iron
13
. The benefit of short-term treatment with i.v. iron has been demonstrated in patients undergoing orthopaedic
25
and cancer surgery
26
-
28
. In addition, administering high-dose i.v. iron pre-operatively, even on the day of surgery, could help prevent postoperative anaemia
29
. This approach is also feasible in iron-deficient COVID-19 patients admitted for urgent procedures. In patients with more profound anaemia, an ultra-short-term treatment course (1-2 days before surgery) of erythropoietin and i.v. iron may be more effective. A regimen of 40,000 IU epoetin alpha and 1000 mg i.v. iron, together with 1 mg subcutaneous vitamin B12 and 5 mg oral folic acid, has been shown to reduce blood transfusion in cardiac surgery patients
30
. The beneficial effects of very short-term treatment with i.v. iron and epoetin alpha have also been observed in elective and non-elective orthopaedic surgery
25
. Intravenous iron is also effective for treating postoperative anaemia, and should be considered, even in cancer patients who are undergoing surgery during the COVID-19 crisis
26
,
31
,
32
.

Patient blood management in critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19

Early reports have described mild anaemia in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU
33
,
34
. In general, the most common aetiologies for anaemia in the ICU are inflammation and iron deficiency. Just as in surgical patients, iron, vitamin B12, folic acid and erythropoietin can be administered in critically ill patients
35
. Intravenous iron formulations are superior to oral formulations in such patients, as enteral iron uptake is reduced in inflammatory states due to increased expression of hepcidin. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis suggested that therapy with erythropoietin may decrease mortality in critically ill adults, even though results were described as hypothesis-generating by the authors
36
. In COVID-19 positive critically ill patients, the risk of thrombosis associated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has to be individually considered before each administration, and mitigated with anticoagulation. When a shortage of blood supply is anticipated, treatment should be initiated early, before anaemia reaches critical levels. To balance the risks, haemoglobin should be maintained at levels sufficient to enable adequate oxygenation. This process can be achieved with below-normal haemoglobin values in most patients. In addition, patients should be anticoagulated adequately whenever possible, and special consideration given to the possible prothrombotic nature of COVID-19 in critically ill patients
37
. Prevention of anaemia is just as important as treatment of anaemia in critically ill patients. Anaemia is aggravated by repeated blood tests in non-bleeding critically ill patients, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or sepsis
38
. Blood sampling is increased in severely affected patients due to frequent blood gas analyses, laboratory testing, and blood culture testing. Two simple ways to prevent iatrogenic blood loss are micro-sampling and the use of blood conservation devices to reduce the amount of discarded blood
39
. For each blood test, the lowest possible amount of blood necessary to perform testing should be drawn, and only tests that are essential for clinical decisions should be ordered.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is common in COVID-19 patients who develop pneumonia
34
,
40
. Transfusion of red cells has been associated with negative clinical effects on the lung, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury or pulmonary hypertension
41
. These side-effects might enhance the severity of ARDS in affected patients
42
. Thus, it is important to carefully consider each indication for transfusion, taking into account individual factors such as age, intravascular volume status of the patient and concomitant diseases. Before transfusing allogeneic red cells, measures that increase oxygen delivery should be utilised, including improvement of oxygen saturation and cardiac output. Total erythrocyte mass is not always reflected by haemoglobin values and it is not advisable to merely focus on transfusion thresholds. Whenever possible, a single-unit policy should be followed in order to limit volume transfused and multiple donor exposure, except in patients with active massive bleeding.

Alterations of coagulation in COVID-19 patients

Several reports describe coagulation alterations in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection
40
,
43
-
45
. In these reports, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were longer in COVID-19-infected vs. non-infected individuals. In addition, more abnormal coagulation parameters were found in advanced disease states and in non-survivors compared with survivors
40
,
44
,
45
, together with elevated fibrinogen concentrations
43
,
44
. Markedly elevated D-dimers were described as the most prominent characteristic, a finding interpreted as overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
44
. A sub-set of patients with the most severe COVID-19 are prone to develop consumptive coagulopathy and a hypercoagulable state. Furthermore, the most severely affected COVID-19 patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for respiratory (or cardiac) failure. This treatment can be life-saving, but also transfusion-intensive with anecdotal reports of frequent clotting within the ECMO circuits. As new insights are gained about the pathophysiology of these prothrombotic alterations in COVID-19 patients, it will be important to adapt therapy accordingly
46
. Early prehospital low-dose aspirin or early in-hospital low molecular weight heparin have been proposed as pre-emptive treatment strategies. However, premature and unsubstantiated changes in therapeutic concepts should be avoided when based merely on anecdotal reports, as the consequences may be deleterious. Patients should be enrolled in ethically approved trials, and the results of these ongoing randomised trials should guide future therapeutic advances in treatment.

To our knowledge, there is no study yet published in which thrombo-elastographic or thrombo-elastometric techniques are used to assess coagulation in COVID-19 infected patients. Monitoring coagulation with viscoelastic point-of-care devices and quick laboratory tests is crucial in all bleeding patients and is recommended by the European Society of Anaesthesiology
47
, the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery, the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology
48
, and by the European Guidelines on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma
49
. Such timely coagulation monitoring allows rapid detection of disturbances in the coagulation system, and to accurately diagnose the abnormality. On this basis, an individualised goal-directed coagulation treatment using coagulation factors according to an algorithm is possible. The success of such treatment algorithms has been shown in cardiac surgery
50
, trauma
51
, and major postpartum haemorrhage
52
. Of particular relevance during the current COVID-19 pandemic is that the use of treatment algorithms can reduce transfusions of red cells, plasma, and platelets as well as admission to ICU, and shorten ventilation time and ICU length of stay
50
-
52
. A simple and pragmatic coagulation algorithm is depicted in Fig.
1
. The success of viscoelastic point-of-care based algorithms is largely independent of the use of thrombo-elastographic or thrombo-elastometric techniques
53
. In addition, in a recent study, the latest models of both types of viscoelastic techniques were found to be largely comparable
54
.

Irrespective of the type of coagulation algorithm used, the early use of tranexamic acid may be recommended to manage the bleeding patient provided there is no contraindication (active DIC or active hypercoagulable state being absolute contraindications)
55
. At present, there are close to 200 meta-analyses that show the success of tranexamic acid in reducing bleeding and the use of allogeneic blood products in surgery and in non-surgical fields. These meta-analyses also document the absence of an increased incidence of thromboembolic adverse outcomes following tranexamic acid administration
4
.

Some COVID-19 infected patients need surgery during their ICU stay. In an early phase, most patients are likely to be in a distinct acute phase response with very high levels of platelets, fibrinogen concentration, Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. Later, some may develop DIC. However, the current level of knowledge is very limited and the difference between patients at different stages of the disease is likely to be significant. Therefore, monitoring coagulation with viscoelastic point-of-care devices and quick laboratory tests is particularly important in COVID-19 infected patients. At the present time we propose using the established coagulation algorithms (Fig.
1
) including the use of tranexamic acid in COVID-19 positive patients with less severe disease suffering from trauma.

Special considerations

During disasters, work forces are overstrained, supply chains are disrupted, manufacturing capacities are reduced or diverted, and infrastructures are undermined in the face of increased demand. These circumstances lead to shortages of crucial medical resources. This reality is exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic by the shortage of personal protective equipment, ventilators, ICU beds, vital medications and other critical equipment for healthcare workers and frontline responders. All this puts medical personnel at great personal risk and forces difficult decisions to be made regarding the allocation of scarce patient resources
56
. Considering the many uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, the full extent of consequences remains unknown. Some models suggest a direct human toll in the tens of thousands in US alone, extrapolating to hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Indirectly, as economies around the world suffer, populations face risks due to disrupted healthcare systems, reduced access to care and preventative measures, impaired mental health and poverty. There is often a sinister inverse relationship between measures of economic prosperity and various health and well-being indicators
57
. Patient blood management can play an important role in mitigating short-term shortages in the midst of the acute phase of the pandemic (and subsequent waves until herd immunity is established through widespread infection or vaccination) and longer-term socio-economic health challenges in the post-COVID-19 world. The main focus of patient blood management on improving patients' outcomes can directly translate into a reduced burden of illness and severity in individual patients, releasing limited resources for other needs. Patient blood management practices prevent anaemia (a global health problem) and reduce allogeneic blood transfusion, resulting not only in the best allocation of resources and cost savings, but also decreased patient morbidity and mortality
6
,
58
. These improved outcomes and the concomitant cost savings are urgently needed as we deal with a pandemic yet to reach its peak, and the ongoing challenges thereafter.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most fundamental aspect of patient blood management is the prevention and management of anaemia. While the exact impact of anaemia on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients is not yet fully understood, data show unequivocally that the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing and chronic conditions is significantly worse. As such, it is not unreasonable to expect that anaemia will also have a negative impact on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients and widespread prevention and management of anaemia might confer some protection against more severe cases of COVID-19.

Conclusion

As we are facing the biggest global health challenge of our lives, only a major collaborative effort will allow us to achieve a positive outcome. Using a patient-centred approach, proven evidence-based principles should be applied and established expert-consensus good practice concepts continued. Patient blood management is one piece of the puzzle needed to save patients' lives. Every drop of blood saved can be decisive, even more so in the critical situation we are currently facing.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially caused clusters of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China, in late 2019
1
and has since rapidly spread in Europe and the United States. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 3,517,345 persons were reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 243,401 persons to have died of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
2
In response, many countries have implemented a series of unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, including large-scale social isolation, travel bans, restriction of public gatherings, and nationwide lockdowns. Although these social distancing strategies have been necessary from a public health standpoint, they have understandably introduced challenges in the management of many chronic medical conditions.
3

Because osteoporosis is a chronic disease, continued treatment is a prerequisite in many patients in order to sustain therapeutic benefits, as is the case with other chronic conditions. With the exception of bisphosphonates, which have a long biologic half-life, other anti-osteoporosis drugs need to be provided in a regularly scheduled manner. Delaying the administration of certain categories of osteoporosis drugs can have ominous consequences for patients, ranging from loss of bone mass to increases in bone turnover and fracture risk. Hip fractures, the most devastating type of fracture, significantly impair mobility and independence and lead to an approximately 25% 1-year mortality rate.
4
Recognizing the potential detrimental effects of abruptly terminating anti-osteoporosis therapy, the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) formed a Steering Committee of bone specialists to address this issue.
5
Here we review available evidence and provide clinical guidance for the management of patients with osteoporosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. We acknowledge both that there is a paucity of data to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations and that treatment modalities are likely to vary according to the status of local and national facilities, such as phlebotomy and infusion therapy centers, as well as outpatient clinics. Thus, these recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion and will require reassessment as the worldwide response to COVID-19 evolves.

Bone mineral density scans

Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing is a helpful tool to assist in the identification and management of patients at high risk of fractures,
6
these scans should be considered as elective. Thus, BMD examinations may need to be postponed when public health guidance recommends the halting of elective imaging procedures. In the absence of BMD testing, fracture risk stratification can still be performed for treatment-naive adults with the use of the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX).
7

Laboratory monitoring

Standard pretreatment laboratory studies, including serum calcium, creatinine, and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, are often obtained before the administration of potent antiresorptive agents, such as intravenous (iv) bisphosphonates and denosumab, in order to minimize risk of inducing hypocalcemia. In patients who are initiating new osteoporosis treatment with a potent antiresorptive agent, we recommend obtaining relevant laboratory studies before first administration. However, the absolute risk of inducing clinically significant hypocalcemia after treatment with either zoledronic acid
8
or denosumab
9
is very low in the absence of significant renal insufficiency. Both to facilitate social distancing guidelines and to minimize patient exposure at phlebotomy centers, we suggest that pretreatment laboratory studies before retreatment with iv bisphosphonates and/or denosumab need not be performed if laboratory values obtained within the preceding year were normal and it is the clinical judgment of the medical provider that the patient's health has been stable. However, we do recommend obtaining laboratory studies for patients with fluctuating renal function and for those who are at higher risk of developing hypocalcemia, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, hypoparathyroidism, or advanced renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease stages 4 or 5) or those maintained on loop diuretics.

Pharmacologic osteoporosis treatment

The initiation of osteoporosis therapy can be done as an outpatient via a non-face-to-face (ie, telephone or video) visit and should not be delayed in patients at high risk for fracture (eg, patients who have recently sustained an osteoporotic fragility fracture or patients taking chronic high-dose glucocorticoids). In particular, oral osteoporosis regimens can be easily initiated during a telemedicine visit; teriparatide and abaloparatide initiation may also be considered but require additional patient training for subcutaneous self-injections that may be more difficult to arrange. Patients who have fractures requiring hospital admission should be considered for osteoporosis medication initiation while hospitalized to minimize the risk of being lost to follow-up in the post-discharge period, which may be further fragmented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, there is no evidence for impaired fracture healing in patients who receive early initiation of osteoporosis treatment, including bisphosphonates.
10
It should be acknowledged, however, that the administration of iv bisphosphonates may cause a post-infusion inflammatory reaction, particularly in treatment-naive patients. Symptoms of the inflammatory reaction, including fever and myalgias, have the potential to complicate the care of hospitalized patients by triggering a COVID-19 evaluation and may prolong hospitalization.

When possible to do safely, patients who are already treated with osteoporosis medications should continue to receive ongoing therapies including oral and iv bisphosphonates, denosumab, estrogen, raloxifene, teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab. There is no evidence that any osteoporosis therapy increases the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection or alters the disease course (in either a positive or negative way). However, there are early signals that COVID-19 may be accompanied by an increased risk for hypercoagulable complications,
11
,
12
in which case caution may be warranted for estrogen and raloxifene use, both of which may modestly increase thrombotic risk.
13
,
14
It may therefore be prudent to instruct patients to temporarily discontinue these hormonal agents if they develop viral respiratory symptoms. Denosumab also bears particular consideration because it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), and RANKL plays a role in T-cell activation. Studies of denosumab in postmenopausal osteoporosis indicate an increased risk of skin and soft tissue infections.
15
However, no infection safety signals have been found in studies of denosumab in patients receiving concurrent immunomodulatory treatment for rheumatoid arthritis
16
-
18
and among patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy for solid-organ tumors.
19
,
20

Depending on the severity of the local COVID-19 outbreak, we acknowledge that there may be disruptions in the administration of osteoporosis treatments. We thus aim to provide guidance about (i) alternative methods of delivering parenteral osteoporosis treatments that are not self-administered (eg, iv bisphosphonates, denosumab, and romosozumab); and (ii) how to handle temporary disruptions in the pharmacologic management of osteoporosis patients.

Alternative methods of delivering parenteral osteoporosis treatments

Off-site clinics: The administration of treatments at locations geographically isolated from COVID-19 ""hot spots"" should be considered whenever possible. However, it should be recognized that this may disadvantage socioeconomically challenged communities if public transportation options are not available.

Home delivery and administration: This is an option if available but may be logistically difficult to arrange due to reliance on home-visiting medical staff. Self-injection of denosumab (and/or romosozumab) has been proposed and is reportedly available in some locales. However, there are important medico-legal issues to consider surrounding the proper product handling and administration, including the small risk of drug-related hypersensitivity reactions that could occur in the absence of a medical provider, although steps to mitigate such potential risks may be in place in some communities.

Drive-through administration of denosumab and/or romosozumab: This may also be logistically difficult to arrange. Further, it is recommended that patients be monitored by a medical provider for 15 minutes after injection in the unlikely event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Temporary disruptions of pharmacologic osteoporosis treatment

In the event that temporary disruption of osteoporosis treatment is necessitated due to COVID-19, we have reviewed evidence about treatment discontinuation effects and have provided recommendations for the delay or temporary transition to other osteoporosis agents. In general, we recommend the resumption of the original osteoporosis treatment plan once circumstances allow.

Bisphosphonates

After bisphosphonate discontinuation, suppressed bone turnover markers (BTMs) slowly return to their baseline concentrations and BMD remains stable or decreases very gradually over a period of years.
21
-
23
The persistent antiresorptive effect of bisphosphonates after treatment discontinuation is dependent on their high affinity for binding hydroxyapatite. To this effect, bisphosphonates with a more pronounced binding capacity for hydroxyapatite, such as alendronate and zoledronate, have been shown to have a more sustained effect on maintenance of BMD and suppression of BTMs compared with risedronate.
24
Some studies also indicate a persistent anti-fracture effect after bisphosphonate discontinuation, although these data are less well-substantiated.
25
,
26
Finally, randomized controlled trials indicate that less frequent dosing of zoledronic acid may provide skeletal benefit and protection against fractures.
27
-
29
In summary, for patients in whom continued treatment with iv bisphosphonates is not feasible, delays of even several months are unlikely to be harmful.

Denosumab

There is evidence that delay of denosumab treatment causes rebound high bone turnover,
30
,
31
rapid bone loss within 1 year,
30
,
31
and increases the risk for the development of multiple vertebral fractures.
32
Reports of vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation have occurred as early as 7 months after the last denosumab injection.
33
The optimal regimen of antiresorptive drugs to mitigate the rebound phenomenon that characterizes denosumab discontinuation is currently being investigated in a number of randomized controlled trials. There is some evidence that oral alendronate may provide protection from denosumab-discontinuation rebound bone loss, especially in the setting of a short period of previous denosumab treatment.
34
,
35
However, multiple vertebral fractures have been described in two patients provided with alendronate after treatment with denosumab for an average of 3.5 years.
36
In comparison to oral bisphosphonate treatment, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether zoledronic acid can prevent rebound bone loss associated with denosumab discontinuation, with most data showing this potent antiresorptive agent to be less effective at maintaining BMD when previous denosumab treatment exceeded 2 years compared with a shorter duration of denosumab therapy.
37
-
39
Furthermore, there is controversy over the optimal timing and dosing of bisphosphonate therapy after denosumab discontinuation, although ongoing randomized controlled trials are expected to shed more light into this matter. It also remains unclear whether less potent antiresorptive medications, such as raloxifene, may be able to prevent the high bone turnover state after denosumab discontinuation.
40
,
41
Regarding transitioning from denosumab to osteoanabolic treatment, there is evidence that switching to teriparatide leads to a high bone turnover state and a temporary but rapid decrease in BMD, especially at cortical skeletal sites.
42
Finally, recent evidence has shown that romosozumab treatment after denosumab discontinuation results in BMD gains, albeit of a smaller magnitude compared with romosozumab administration alone in treatment-naive patients.
43

Based on the available data, we strongly recommend the temporary transition to an oral bisphosphonate (such as weekly alendronate) for patients in whom continued treatment with denosumab is not feasible within 7 months of their most recent prior denosumab injection. For patients with known upper gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, we suggest that these patients be transitioned to monthly ibandronate or weekly/monthly risedronate based on reports that these medications may have fewer upper GI side effects.
44
,
45
Bisphosphonates are contraindicated for patients with chronic renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rates [eGFR] levels <30 to 35 mL/min); however, in such patients, the off-label provision of lower-dose oral bisphosphonate (eg, alendronate 35 mg weekly, or alendronate 70 mg every 2 weeks) may be cautiously considered. We note that there is no published evidence to support these off-label regimens, and therefore clinicians should weigh the unknown benefits and potential risks of these regimens against the concern for rebound-associated loss of bone mass and vertebral fracture occurrence after denosumab discontinuation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Teriparatide and abaloparatide

After teriparatide discontinuation, BMD progressively declines over the course of the first year,
46
but there is no evidence of increased rebound fracture risk. On the contrary, follow-up of the pivotal Fracture Prevention Trial with teriparatide (FPT)
47
suggested that some anti-fracture efficacy was maintained for up to 18 months after teriparatide was discontinued.
48
However, given the aforementioned progressive bone loss after discontinuation, it is likely that most of the beneficial anti-fracture effects of teriparatide will eventually dissipate unless followed by an antiresorptive agent. Multiple antiresorptive agents have been demonstrated to further increase BMD after teriparatide discontinuation.
42
,
49
-
51
Interestingly, regimens of cyclical teriparatide treatment (ie, 3 months on-treatment followed by 3 months off-treatment) given for 4 years cumulatively showed similar increases in BMD compared with standard daily teriparatide treatment provided over 2 years,
52
,
53
demonstrating proof of concept that short-term interruptions of teriparatide may not negatively impact long-term BMD increases, so long as treatment can be restarted within 3 months. On the other hand, pretreatment with bisphosphonates appear to blunt the efficacy of teriparatide,
54
-
56
evidence that may dampen enthusiasm for using bisphosphonates as bridging agents during a temporary disruption of teriparatide treatment.

Given that abaloparatide has a similar physiologic action as teriparatide, it is presumed that abaloparatide also has no prolonged BMD effects after its discontinuation. Fewer data are available about approaches to transition from abaloparatide to other osteoporosis agents, although the specific regimen of abaloparatide followed by alendronate has been shown to be an effective sequential regimen in postmenopausal osteoporosis.
57

Based on the data above, for patients in whom continued treatment with teriparatide or abaloparatide is not feasible, we suggest a delay in treatment. If this delay exceeds 2 to 3 months, consider a temporary transition to an oral bisphosphonate.

Romosozumab

There is evidence that romosozumab discontinuation causes rapid bone loss within 1 year if not followed by another osteoporosis treatment.
58
Indices of bone resorption also increase within 3 months of romosozumab cessation,
58
although there is no indication that discontinuation leads to an increased risk of fractures. There is evidence that transitioning from romosozumab to either alendronate or denosumab leads to continued gains in BMD.
59
,
60
However, pretreatment with alendronate might somewhat blunt the increases in hip BMD anticipated to occur with romosozumab
61
compared with the increases found in treatment-naive patients.
59
,
60
Finally, bone turnover marker data suggest that the most active period of bone formation with romosozumab occurs within the first 6 months of treatment, after which time romosozumab mirrors the biomarker profile of an antiresorptive agent.
59
,
60

Based on the available evidence, we suggest a delay in treatment for patients in whom continued treatment with romosozumab is not feasible. If this delay exceeds 2 to 3 months, consider a temporary transition to oral bisphosphonate. In patients who have already received >6 months of romosozumab treatment, it is possible that a more permanent transition to oral bisphosphonates could be considered.

Conclusion

Although it is hoped that widespread lockdowns may begin to be eased as we gain better control of COVID-19, it is increasingly likely that intermittent social distancing will be required over the next 18 months.
62
During this time of uncertainty, it is imperative that we continue to provide the best care possible for our patients by addressing the clinically important issue of osteoporosis, while acknowledging various logistic challenges that have the potential to disrupt care. We hope that these recommendations can provide a practical guide to the management of osteoporosis patients during this unprecedented pandemic.

W
e are all interested
in this new illness, COVID-19, whose nature is gradually being revealed. Will it have a prolonged recovery phase in some people, like glandular fever? If the sudden worsening at day 7 to 10 is due to a cytokine storm, would anti-TNF inhibitors administered early prevent this? Interestingly patients with inflammatory bowel disease on anti-TNF inhibitors, do better than those on other immunosuppressive treatments.(1)

What should we do about the hypercoagulable state?(2) Will COVID-19 lead to lung fibrosis in some patients, like Middle east Respiratory Syndrome, caused by another coronavirus?(3) But, beyond a few virologists, who has noticed that the spike protein of Sars-Cov-2, against which teams are competing to develop a vaccine, is highly homologous with a human HERV protein, syncytin-1.(4) What, indeed, are HERV proteins? What are HERVs?

HERVs are human endogenous retroviruses, that is to say retroviruses whose DNA, over millions of years, has become part of our DNA. All retroviruses, such as HIV, contain viral RNA which is transcribed into DNA and inserted into the host genome. Viral DNA normally leads to the production of more viral RNA, viral proteins and infective particles. In contrast HERV DNA, due to certain faults, is no longer translated into RNA and proteins. Astonishingly 8% of human DNA consists of these preserved but inactive retrovirus DNA sequences, more than is devoted to DNA coding known human proteins. HERVs have been called 'fossil viruses'. They are largely 'selfish genetic elements', that is to say that they are reproduced without any benefit to the host, but merely perpetuate themselves as genes.(5)

Will the COVID-19 pandemic trigger the expression of HERV proteins in some patients and lead to the emergence of new diseases as it wanes, just as occurred after the 1918 flu pandemic?

Do any these HERV sequences in our DNA have an active role, or are they all dormant? A few are indeed expressed. Syncytin-1, which is a HERV derived protein, causes fusion of cells in the trophoblast and has a role in placentation. Why should a virus derived protein have a role in cell fusion? Perhaps because fusing to the host cell membrane is a virus's first task. The expression of other HERV proteins, triggered by viruses, especially EBV, can be harmful.(1) It is now suggested that this is what happens in multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes.(6) In MS raised levels of a particular HERV virus and protein can be found in the CSF and in active MS plaques.(7,8) In the case of MS, the trigger is probably EBV infection.(9) In type 1 diabetes the protein pHERV-W Env is expressed in beta calls.(10) Temelimab, a monoclonal antibody against pHERV-W Env has been trialled in MS and type 1 diabetes. It has had measurable success in MS, initiating remyelination of nerve cells, but no success yet in Type 1 diabetes.(11,12)

That very common disorder, schizophrenia, with a prevalence of 1% of the population, may be associated with the expression of HERVs.(13) It has been known for a long time that schizophrenia can be triggered by infection; there was a large surge in cases after the 1918 influenza pandemic.(14)

Three questions can now be asked about the remarkable homology recorded between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HER-W derived protein syncytin-1.(4) Firstly, is that why COVID-19 has adverse effects on pregnancy and child birth? (15) Secondly, is the protection women enjoy relative to men due to immune modulation by the expression of syncytin-1 during childbirth and placentation? If so, do nulliparous women not share that relative protection? It should be straightforward to find this out.

Finally, will the COVID-19 pandemic trigger the expression of HERV proteins in some patients and lead to the emergence of new diseases as it wanes, just as occurred after the 1918 flu pandemic? There are already suggestions that this might be the case for some neurological presentations.(16) Will somebody be measuring syncytin-1 in the CSF of these patients?

CV, a 70 y.o. man, became feverish in the evening of March 11th, but fever completely disappeared the day after. In the following days CV complained of sore throat, severe myalgia, weakness and anorexia. Cough or shortness of breath was not present. Since CV lives in Milan and is a medical doctor having contacts with a lot of people, a SARS-CoV-2 infection was supposed. In accordance with the recommendations of the National and Regional Health Authority for the pandemic outbreak, CV decided to stay at home, assuming only intermittent therapy to improve myalgia (diclofenac). A week after the symptoms progressively improved and only mild sore throat persisted.

On April 2nd dyspnoea, together with increased cardiac rate (110-120 bpm), suddenly appeared and then it was decided to call on the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Maggiore-Policlinico of the University of Milan. Here an arterial blood sample was taken that revealed the signs of respiratory alkalosis together with metabolic acidosis. A chest-x-ray film did not show significant abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast agent was performed. It showed the presence of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) involving secondary and segmental branches (
Fig. 1
). Only few limited sub-pleural ground glass areas were noted. Peripheral blood examination documented the presence of very high level of D-dimer (more than 5 times the normal values), with light reduction of platelet count and a C-reactive protein just above the normal limits.

CV was transferred to an internal medicine unit reserved to COVID-19 suspected patients, since the clinical condition did not require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Here treatment with anticoagulant therapy (enoxaparin 8000 U BID) was introduced, and a respiratory support with low flux oxygen (FiO2 24%) was given. No signs of significant PAPs increase or overcharge of the right cardiac ventricle were observed on echocardiographic examination. No signs of deep venous thrombosis were found on Doppler examination. A nasal-pharyngeal swab sample taken ad the admission time confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Rapid improvement of respiratory function and reduction of cardiac rate was recorded in the following few days. CV was then discharged by the hospital on April 7th since oxygen support was no more needed. Anticoagulant therapy was shifted to apixaban 5 mg BID to be continued for six months.

The occurrence of a hypercoagulable state in the course of critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19 is an emerging issue [

]. This may induce al large variety of intravascular thrombotic phenomena ranging from fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a more limited venous and arterial thrombosis, namely PE. It has been suggested that many deaths during COVID-19 in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission could be ascribed to this coagulopathy, and overall to incidental DIC in patients with severe pneumonitis [

], it was reported that prophylactic heparin treatment in ICU-admitted patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia reduced the mortality rate in comparison to the patients that did not receive it.

It has been suggested that infection-related release of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines can cause an endothelial damage, activate the coagulation cascade, and consequently may predispose to thrombotic events that may also occur in pulmonary vasculature [

]. These guidelines suggest to perform D-dimer, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients who present with COVID-19, and to admit to the hospital those patients with important signs of coagulopathy (namely very high levels of D-dimer), also in absence of other concerns. In view of the risk of occurrence of such a hypercoagulable state, the use of prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin in all the patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19, including those not requiring ICU has been proposed [

]. A recent study on ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has shown that thrombotic events were recorded in 31% of them with a large prevalence of PE (81%). It is worth noting that all of these patients received thromboprophylaxis [

The present case report may suggest some additional considerations regarding the therapeutic and clinical approach to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

a.

Even patients with mild clinical manifestations, not requiring hospital admission may develop PE in the course of COVID-19. This suggests that inflammation-related endothelial damage could not be related to the presence and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the performance of coagulation tests could be indicated in all patients having certain and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

b.

Hypercoagulable state may persist for long time and also induce late thromboembolic events.

c.

At least prophylactic dose of anticoagulant therapy could be introduced in all patients with COVID-19, including non-hospitalized patients.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and in much of the Westernized World, contributing to considerable morbidity. Several of these obesity-related morbidities are associated with greater risk of death with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) penetrates human cells through direct binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors on the cell surface. ACE2 expression in adipose tissue is higher than that in lung tissue, which means that adipose tissue may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Obese patients also have worse outcomes with COVID-19, including respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. Clinicians need to be more aggressive when treating obese, especially severely obese, patients with COVID-19."

Epidemics and pandemics in human history are not the exception but the rule. Bill Gates was prophetic in 2015 'if anything kills ten million people in the next few decades, it is likely to be an infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, microbes'.

The Black Death (1347), the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Spanish Flu outbreak which killed 50 million people occurred in 1918. In 1997, the H5N1 bird flu epidemic occurred and was followed, in 2002, by the coronavirus outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. These were followed by the re-emerging pathogen epidemic; Ebola virus, unexpectedly, exploded in West Africa in 2013. While the world was celebrating the success of victory over Ebola, in 2015, the Zika epidemic reared its head. Significant neurological complications only featured in the Zika outbreak: congenital microcephaly, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myelitis and meningoencephalitis.

Coronaviruses

The most well-studied coronavirus is the betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, that has provided model systems for the study of encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. In humans, coronaviruses usually cause common cold symptoms. However, the emergence of two zoonotic betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, revealed their full pathogenic potential.

Highlights

Neurological manifestations has been reported in SARS-CoV2 infection recently.

*

SARS-CoV2 could spread to the brain hematogenously or through the cribriform plate.

*

Neurological symptoms can be due to systemic illness or viral invasion of the CNS.

Abstract

Background

Increasing research reports neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement.

Objective

To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease.

Results

A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections.

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

Conclusion

An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research."

Dear Editor,

We read with great interest the report by Dr. Poyiadji and colleagues regarding acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in a COVID-19 patient (1). In the report they provided direct image evidence of serious brain lesions that can occur in COVID-19 patients. A study of a cohort of patients by Mao et al found that a significant number of COVID-19 patients had one or more neurological symptoms including dizziness, headache, hypogeusia, hyposmia and in some patients impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular ischemic stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage (2). Thus investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Poyiadji et al suggested that elevated inflammatory cytokines, an feature of COVID-19, cause neuroinflammation, which results in damage to neuronal and non-neuronal cells and consequently the brain lesions of their patient (1). Another feature of COVID-19 is hypercoagulability (3). It can be hypothesized that actions of inflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells induces changes in the blood brain barrier, allowing small thrombi, formed elsewhere in the body, to migrate across the blood brain barrier into the brain to cause sporadic thromboembolism in cerebral arterioles, capillaries, and/or venules, resulting in localized hypoxic/ischemic damage.

Thus, to prevent and/or address the brain complications of COVID-19, patients need to be closely monitored for biochemical signs (inflammatory cytokine storm and hypercoagulability) and additionally with CT angiography (CTA). The acquisition of both head and neck (aortic arch to vertex) CTA allows the visualization of all extracranial and intracranial arteries supplying the brain. The technique is useful in detecting the presence of a clot, characteristics of thrombus, tissue ischemia and collaterals beyond occlusive thrombus. Furthermore, in these patients the supposed endothelial damage to blood vessels makes these vessels leaky. By detecting regions of very low blood flow (or blood volume) or regions of brain with increased blood-brain barrier permeability, CTA can help predict brain regions with increased risk of hemorrhage. In addition, for a comprehensive evaluation physicians should take into consideration the pattern of brain structural changes commonly seen in patient with pulmonary disease: cerebral small-vessel disease, small subcortical infarcts, white matter microstructural abnormalities, cerebral microbleeds, and cerebral atrophy (4,5)."

There
is as yet very little in the published literature on the neurological
consequences of Covid-19 (the disease caused by infection with SARS-Cov-2). The
first extensive report - a retrospective consecutive case series of 214 patients
from Wuhan, China, with either moderate or severe COVID-19, was published in
JAMA Neurology in early April 2020.(1) Of these patients, 36.4% had
neurological symptoms, some specific to the central or peripheral nervous
systems (e.g. anosmia, dysgeusia, stroke, myopathy), and others less so
(headache, depressed level of consciousness, dizziness, seizures). In the case
of the latter symptoms, it is difficult to know whether they are due to the
disease itself, or to the body's reaction to it. More severe neurological
symptoms were generally seen in patients with more severe respiratory
involvement, but again it is difficult to be certain whether this reflects
direct neurological involvement, or the presence of common co-morbidities such
as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity.

In
addition to this, isolated case reports of more serious neurological conditions
associated with Covid-19 are starting to appear, including potential cases of
encephalitis or encephalopathy,(2,3) acute disseminated necrotising
encephalomyelitis,(4) and Guillain-Barre syndrome.(5)

How
might SARS-Cov-2 affect neurological function? We know, from experience with
SARS and MERS, that in rare cases coronavirus infection can be associated with
conditions that affect the peripheral neurological system (PNS). Patients with SARS
have been reported to develop axonal neuropathy or myopathy, possibly due to a
virally-induced vasculitis in these tissues.(6) A handful of such cases have
been reported following MERS infection, though it is again unclear whether
these were due to the infection itself, or to the consequences of critical
illness and/or some of the antiviral treatments given.(7) Reports of
parasthesiae and skeletal muscle injury in Covid-19 patients are intriguing,
but further neurophysiological and histological studies are needed to
understand the pathophysiological processes behind these observations.

There
is no doubt that coronaviruses can potentially enter the central nervous system
(CNS). Post-mortem examination of the brains of patients dying of SARS showed
histological changes in cortex and diencephalic neurons.(8) There is now good
evidence that SARS-Cov-2 invades target cells by binding of its surface spike
protein to the ACE2 receptor, which is distributed widely in human body
tissues, including the central nervous system.(9) The most likely portal of
entry is ACE2-expressing cells in the olfactory epithelium, whence axons and
dendrites extend to the olfactory bulb, and on towards the olfactory nucleus in
the pyriform cortex. In rodents exposed to SARS-CoV by inhalation, the virus
was found in the olfactory bulb, and within four days it could be detected in
the pyriform cortex, and in dorsal nucleus of the raphe in the brainstem.(10) It
is likely that the high prevalence of anosmia and dysgeusia in patients with
Covid-19 is due to viral olfactory neuropathy, but whether this risk is
increased by nicotine exposure through smoking (including e-cigarettes, or vaping)
because of functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2, is
not clear.(11) Some authorities to speculate that respiratory distress in
Covid-19 patients may be due to virally-induced dysfunction in central
respiratory control centres, though this is disputed.(12,13)

Finally,
because of the effects that SARS-Cov-2 has on the blood and endothelium - in severe
cases hypertension, hypercoagulability, microthrombi, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) are all reported, as well as the risk of
embolism from cardiac injury - patients with Covid-19 may be at risk of
cerebrovascular complications, such as ischaemic stroke, cerebral haemorrhage,
or cerebral venous thrombosis. At present only one such case has been reported
in which a direct link between Covid-19 infection and intracranial haemorrhage
is postulated.(14)

All
neurologists should be on the lookout for cases of neurological disease
associated with SARS-Cov-2 infection. It will be difficult in many instances to
be certain about the exact pathophysiology of the association. In the last two
weeks I have seen a case of facial palsy following on from an (untested)
illness, very likely to have been Covid-19, and a patient in whom a previous
tendency to migraine was reactivated halfway through a proven bout of Covid-19,
and outlasted the resolution of other systemic features by a couple of weeks:
are these direct effects of the virus, or consequences of the body's immune
reaction to it? Time - and more research - will tell.

In an forthcoming blog, I will look at the indirect neurological consequences of Covid-19: what effect is the pandemic having on neurological services in the UK and beyond?

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in December of 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. Since the outbreak, various reports detail its symptoms and outcomes, primarily focusing on respiratory complications. However, reports are emerging of the virus' effects systemically, including that of the nervous system. A review of all current published literature was conducted, and we report that headache and anosmia were common neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2. Less common symptoms include seizure, stroke and isolated cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Further research is now warranted to precisely determine the relationship between those patients developing neurological sequelae, their clinical state and any subsequent morbidity and mortality.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are pathogens that largely affect and subsequently cause symptoms of the respiratory system. An outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December of 2019 saw the introduction of a new coronavirus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. This novel virus, which has consequently sparked a global pandemic, has also been widely reported to display a range of respiratory manifestations. Milder, and most commonly, symptoms include fever, fatigue and cough; however, more severe cases of the disease can induce respiratory distress, renal and cardiac failure and eventually death.
1

In addition to respiratory symptoms, reports are emerging of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, which range from milder presentations such as headache to severe complications such as seizures and strokes. We provide a comprehensive review of the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its outcomes on mortality and propose the implications this has on clinical practice now and in the future.

1.1 Literature search strategy

A comprehensive electronic literature search was done on PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Cochrane database, Google Scholar and Ovid in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify the articles that discussed the neurological presentations and relation with COVID-19. Keywords used were ""Neurology"" ""COVID-19"" ""SARS-CoV2"" ""Neurological manifestations"" ""Nervous system"" ""Guillain-Barre syndrome"" ""Neuropathy"" ""Outcomes"" ""Stroke"" ""Nerve"" ""Critical care"". The search terms were used as keywords and in combination as MeSH terms to maximize the output from literature findings. A staged literature search was done, whereby a separate literature search was performed for each section within this article and all the relevant studies were identified and summarized separately. If a paper is reporting on many aspects of COVID-19 and neurology aspect, then the results have been shared between different parts of this review. The relevant articles are cited and referenced within each section separately. No limit placed on publication time or language of the article. All the relevant articles were identified and screened by three authors; the results are summarized in narrative manner in each relevant section within the text of this review. A summary table of each section is provided where appropriate.

Studies were included if they have reported outcomes on any aspects of neurology in relation to COVID-19; the main exclusion criteria were editorials, commentary, narrative reviews with no reports on case outcomes or proposed treatment method. All the studies and data collection were done by two authors (AW and MA), and disagreements were resolved by consensus and involvement of senior author (AH).

2 RESULTS

PRISMA flow chart is reported as in Figure
1
. A total of 339 articles were found; after removal of duplicates and non-original research papers, a total of 38 articles were used for full-text screening; and finally, only 31 studies met the final inclusion criteria and were included in our study. They are summarized in Table
1
. Among those studies, there were 13 case reports, 2 observation studies of between 8-382 case-cohort size, 13 retrospective, 2 prospective and 1 cross-sectional study. Among the 31 studies, 7 reported on Guillain-Barre syndrome, 11 reported on headache, 5 reported on olfactory dysfunction, and 5 reported on acute cerebrovascular accidents.

2.1 Mechanism of neurological pathology

The respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are well documented and known. There is an increasing body of significant anecdotal evidence suggesting anosmia as being a symptom of SARS-CoV-2, giving rise to the possibility that there may be a degree of neurological involvement with the infection.

It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to the CNS by one of two ways: firstly, by systemic vascular dissemination and, secondly, more locally across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, which may or may not have implications regarding the much-reported anosmia that patients with SARS-CoV-2 experience.
2
Baig et al propose that once in the systemic circulation, the virus invades neural tissue due to its properties of neurotropism. Here, it binds to and interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the capillary endothelium.
2

There is certainly prescience for SARS-CoV-2 possessing such neuroinvasive properties. Like its sister virus SARS-CoV responsible for the outbreak in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to cells via ACE2, which it binds via spike proteins.
2
ACE2 has previously been reported to be expressed in the epithelium of the upper and lower airways, alongside the capillary endothelium of the central nervous system (CNS).
3
A study conducted into the structural integrity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed an 10- to 20-fold increase in affinity to ACE2 when compared to the SARS-CoV spike protein.
4
This could be explained by the fact that whilst structurally similar, the two spike glycoproteins are not identical, as identified by a BLASTp search of the two structures.
4
This may also explain why differences in the prevalence of neurological manifestations are being reported between the sister viruses.

Yet, it must be noted that not all human cell lines which express ACE2 are liable to infection with the novel coronavirus. However, despite the paucity of data regarding the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, there is an increasing awareness that its neurological manifestations are something to be recognized alongside its more well-understood respiratory presentation.

2.2 Neurological manifestations

After having conducted a review of all the literature on PubMed pertaining to the neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 using key terms such as ""Covid AND neurology""; ""Covid AND nervous system"", we summarize the findings of 31 such papers that were available to review at the time in Table
1
. Key symptoms reported were headache and dysfunction of olfaction and gustatory sensation. However, it is important to note that no papers as of yet have sought to determine whether neurological involvement is a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2, something which we feel may be worthwhile.

It is worth mentioning that all studies in this area to date limit themselves to patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2. Such a population are more likely to have significant other co-morbidities, and this may influence the rate of neurological sequelae. Studies investigating the incidence of neurological and other extra-respiratory symptoms in patients within the community are called for. Whether neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are as a direct result of the neuroinvasive properties of the virus or as an indirect consequence of downstream multi-organ dysfunction and aberrant biochemistry is yet to be fully understood, most likely however, is it a combination of both.

2.2.1 General neurological symptoms

Given the global nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of any large-scale observational studies investigating the CNS involvement of the novel coronavirus is surprising. Numerous individual case reports exist which suggests that some patients exhibit neuropsychiatric complications of the virus such as altered consciousness
5
and encephalopathy
6
; however, such reports are limited by their power. Of the limited published research available, most centre in China from the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An early study from city of Wuhan, China, of 214 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 reported that over a third (36.4%) of patients had some degree of neurological involvement suggesting that this may be an underreported and overlooked component of the disease course. They noted that headache and dizziness were the two most reported CNS manifestations at 17% and 13%, respectively. The incidence of more severe neurological sequelae such as cerebrovascular accidents and seizures was low at 3% and 0.5%, respectively. Those with ""severe"" infections with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be more likely to suffer from neurological complications; however, the authors did not specify the methodology of distinguishing between a severe and non-severe infection with SARS-CoV-2.
7

Interestingly, they noted that most neurological manifestations occurred early on in the disease which may pose to be an important early predictor of future clinical deterioration. Another similar such retrospective series by Chen et al from the city of Wuhan described that confusion (9%) and headache (8%) were symptoms reported by such patients; importantly however, neurological complaints were significantly less prevalent than the typical respiratory symptoms of cough (82%) and dyspnoea (31%).
8
More significant and potentially long-lasting neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 were highlighted by Li et al in a study of 221 patients, and 6% developed severe neurological disease: ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage of cerebral vein thrombosis, of which a significant proportion died as a result.
9

2.2.2 Stroke

Worryingly, Oxley et al
10
reported five cases of large vessel stroke in patients younger than 50 who had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The youngest two patients, aged 33 and 37, had no previous medical history. Two further studies detailing the rate of thromboembolic complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 noted the incidence of ischaemic stroke to be 1.6%
11
and 2.5%,
12
respectively. Both authors recognized that the incidence of thrombotic complications was remarkably high for their particular institutions. There are clearly additional risk factors predisposing patients with SARS-CoV-2 to develop thromboembolic stroke beyond the traditional cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities and those pertinent to a protracted stay within intensive care settings.

The thrombo-inflammatory nature that SARS-Cov-2 predisposes patients to, was described by Connor and colleagues who reported the coagulative parameters in 16 critically ill patients.
13
They found that fibrinogen (94%), platelet (62%) and D-dimer (100%) levels were increased, as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (100%). They propose a correlation between inflammation and subsequent coagulopathy, by IL-6 and fibrinogen, respectively.
13
Upon damage to the alveoli, an inflammatory state is generated, and as a result, the production of inflammatory cytokines is released, including IL-6.

The downstream effects are broadly categorized into two sequelae: firstly, the production of pro-coagulative factors and, secondly, damage to capillary endothelium resulting in dysregulation of its anti-thrombotic properties. Both of which result in the formation of microvascular thrombosis, that in turn have the potential to embolize systemically.
13
The pathophysiology of pro-thrombotic states following viral infection has been extensively documented and mirrors the proposed mechanism by Connor et al However, we must also consider the possibility that the predisposition to coagulopathy and thrombotic events may well be explained by the long stays in ITU and consequent immobility.

2.2.3 Guillain-barre syndrome

There have also been eleven confirmed case reports and another potential report of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) as being a significant neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. Of the eleven cases in published literature, there is considerable variability in the onset of features of GBS and the typical respiratory symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. One paper reported symptoms of GBS at initial presentation to healthcare settings alongside only mild fever,
14
whereas a further nine patients reported symptoms of GBS, five to eleven days post-diagnosis with the novel coronavirus
15
-
19
.
Despite the inconsistent onset of symptoms in relation to the diagnosis of COVID-19, it is reassuring that the majority of reports describe consistent clinical features of marked lower limb weakness over upper limb and loss of deep tendon reflexes with variable sensory abnormalities. Interestingly however, raised cerebrospinal fluid protein was not universal in this cohort of patients, and in patients with significant respiratory compromise from SARS-CoV-2, measuring vital capacity due to neuromuscular failure from GBS to further support the diagnosis may not be plausible.

Another report by Zhao et al suggests GBS as a presenting symptom of the novel coronavirus but it is unclear whether this is a true association or merely coincidental.
20
It is well documented that GBS is associated with recent inoculation from a potential range of pathogens, which in itself can explain the clinical heterogenicity of the disease.
21
Several mechanisms by which a virus induces an acute areflexic state in GBS have been proposed. Most likely is that antibodies against surface glycoproteins are produced against a pathogen which also respond to similar native protein structures found of the surface of neurones leading to the clinical features seen in GBS.
19
Other plausible theories include one described by McGonagle et al who describe a ""macrophage activation syndrome,"" also known as cytokine storm, and the subsequent hyperinflammation may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of GBS in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
22

A clear time lag between infection with the primary causative pathogen and development of neurological sequelae is the classic phenotype of GBS and has been described as the ""post-infectious"" presentation. However, it is clear that from some case reports, this post-infectious phenotype may not explain why a select number of patients present with either concurrent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and neurological involvement or those that present with GBS initially. Zhao et al
20
proposed a so-called ""parainfectious"" profile pattern whereby GBS occurs at the same time of an acute episode of infection. This may go some way to explain some of the early onset cases of GBS, some of which preceded without significant respiratory involvement and in the absence of a history of any other plausible infection known to cause GBS.

Toscano et al
15
raised an important point in being able to distinguish between GBS and critical illness polyneuropathy, particularly in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who have prolonged admission to intensive care. These consequences of extended intensive care are typically seen later in the course of major illness than GBS but as we have explored, relying on purely time as a differentiator may prove to be difficult.

Historical research has shown that coronaviruses do have the potential to induce demyelinating disease in mice, albeit a central demyelination type picture.
23
There has been an interesting case of GBS overlapping with Bickerstaff's encephalitis documented in the previous MERS-CoV
24
outbreak and a report of a 5-year-old developing GBS after contraction of coronavirus OC43.
25
So, in combination with animal models, previous reports of neurological involvement in sister viruses and current emerging reports, it does seem that GBS is associated with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. But due to so few published reports and the difficulty in proving a direct cause and effect relationship between a single pathogen, it may be complex to explore this further in clinical practice. The neurological symptoms reported by patients are represented in Figure
2
.

2.2.4 Critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy

The long-stay admissions that some patients are currently experiencing may also pose another issue, that of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), in particular critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM). Case reports from SARS-CoV detail patients who experienced CIPNM following infection with the virus.
26
The underlying mechanism, though not fully understood, is thought to be due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that results.
27
This mediates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, which affect the microcirculation of both the central and peripheral nervous system by reducing oxygen and nutrient delivery.
27
It is also important to note that risk factors for PICS have been identified and include long durations of mechanical ventilation, hypoxia and sepsis, features that are common to severe SARS-CoV-2 cases.
27
Yet, no reports detail such symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 patients thus far; however, due to the similarity of the sister viruses, this may be a potential long-term complication.

2.3 How neurology affects outcomes and mortality

Current published studies have suggested that neurological involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 does seem to be associated with a more ""severe"" infection and subsequent mortality. However currently, no direct cause and effect has been attributed to neurological deterioration in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and this relationship could just as plausibly be explained by association with other multi-organ system failures. The direct effect on mortality and morbidity in such ""neurological involving"" patients is yet to be elucidated.

Interestingly, peripheral nervous system involvement by way of anosmia has been shown to be the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 in 36% of patients a recent Spanish case-control study. These so-called smell and taste disorders (STD) were found to be significantly more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 patients than in influenza patients.
28
This opens the possibility of more prompt isolation of suspected cases and control of the pandemic if the typical symptoms of fever and cough are indeed preceded by anosmia, even if only for a select group of people.

It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses such as avian influenza and SARS-CoV, can infiltrate the mammalian brainstem via trans-synaptic transfer which can lead to dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory centres of brainstem.
2
It has therefore been suggested that CNS infiltration of SARS-CoV-2 may explain the deterioration of some patient's respiratory effort and their subsequent need for ventilation. Hence, close and serial neurological observations as an adjunct to routine serial observations may prove to be an early warning marker of impending deterioration. This of course needs further study.

2.4 Implications on clinical practice

Whilst respiratory symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are well recognized and subsequently protocols are in place to screen for and manage these, scope remains for this to be broadened to cover neurological symptoms of the disease.

As referenced to previously, the first paper to describe neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 patients concluded that symptoms were much more common in patients with ""severe"" forms of the disease, defined by respiratory symptoms.
7
They also reported that typical symptoms, such as cough and lethargy, are less pronounced in severely unwell patients.
7

The implications this has on current clinical practice are therefore twofold. Firstly, that all patients, but especially those with ""severe"" SARS-CoV-2, must be monitored for the progression of neurological symptoms, as this may indicate a worsening of their condition. This should also include coagulation parameters, as suggested by Connor's et al due to the predisposition of thrombosis the virus conveys. Secondly, that patients presenting with new-onset focal neurology, with or without the presence of coryzal symptoms, should be reviewed and treated with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This will allow the early detection of the disease and therefore prevention of deterioration or transmission.

To fully understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system, it is essential that documentation of all neurological symptoms is collected for patients infected with the disease, so that further analysis can be performed into neurological manifestations. An aspect of SARS-CoV-2, not yet fully understood, is the long-term sequelae the virus may have on different systems of the body
48
,
47
,
50
,
49
. Again, detailed documentation and long-term follow-up of recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients will allow conclusions to be drawn on this area.

2.5 Future research

More data are required to establish the prevalence and, importantly, the implications of neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients, both short- and long-term, including mortality rates. As more case reports become available, we hope a stronger correlation can be established between the two. Diligent documentation of all neurological symptoms is recommended to help achieve this. The mechanism underlying the neuroinvolvement of SARS-CoV-2 is also yet to be fully understood and remains an area of interest. Identifying modes of transmission is essential in possibly reducing spread and establishing novel therapeutics, to target the virus.

3 CONCLUSION

The underlying pathophysiology of neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 remains to be fully determined. Increasing numbers of papers are reporting neurological involvement in patients, but more data are required to adequately correlate the two and the impact this has clinically. We recommend close monitoring for neurological symptoms and coagulopathy, and to have a low threshold for patients presenting with new-onset focal neurology, as possible carriers of the disease.

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting 2.7 million individuals globally as of April 25, 2020, with more than 187,000 deaths. An increasing body of evidence has supported central nervous system involvement.

Methods

We conducted a review of the reported data for studies concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines.

Results

Central nervous system manifestations range from vague nonfocal complaints to severe neurological impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether the neurological dysfunction results from direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus could affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction, in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of the ongoing scientific and clinical findings.

Conclusions

The present review has consolidated the current body of data regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discussed the reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19, and highlighted the recommendations for patient management. Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons have also been provided.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. Based on knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the SARS and MERS epidemics, we might expect to see rare cases of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Recent developments: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations, but many lack detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy is relatively common, being reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7.5%) of 214 hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in 8 patients to date, and Guillain-Barre syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common and may occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 1.6-6% of hospitalised COVID-19 cases. So far, 88 patients have been described, mostly with ischaemic stroke, who frequently have vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin.

Where next?: Careful clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease, such as hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy, from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus; these include infectious, para- and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Recognising SARS-CoV-2 neurological disease in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic may prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will remain small. However, these patients may be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so much of the population infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health, social and economic costs, may be large. Healthcare planners and policymakers must prepare for this eventuality. The many ongoing studies investigating the neurological association will increase our knowledge base.

Abstract

Background

Much of the focus regarding the global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic complications. However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician.

Discussion

COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide. While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications.

Conclusions

When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19."

Abstract

Background: Last winter, a new coronavirus-induced pneumonia, COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country due to its high infectivity. Although several researches on its clinical characteristics have been published, indicators and its dynamic changes during the disease progression are still not clear and need to be further explored.

Methods: We retrospectively studied 165 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to five hospitals in and outside Wuhan from January 2 to February 5, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, etc. were extracted. A series of factors indicating disease progression were screened out from two patient groups according to the CT imaging score. The correlation between the CT imaging score and the levels of each indicators, and the dynamic changes of these selected indicators during disease progression, were analyzed.

Findings: The data showed that, in addition to the differences reported already, chest CT presented that most patients (95.4%) had bilateral patchy shadows or low-middle leaf frosted glass shadows in the lung. The lung pathological changes were evaluated according to CT imaging score, and we found that the CT imaging score were closely correlated with the disease severity. The higher the CT imaging score is, the more severe the patient is. Based on CT imaging score, a series of enzymes, inflammation markers, and coagulation-related indicators including IL-6, C-reactive protein(CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A (SAA), Serum ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), D-dimer and fibrinogen (FIB) were screened out. The levels of these indicators were increased in the group with higher CT imaging score. Correlation analysis showed that the levels of IL-6, CRP, LDH, AST, D-dimer and FIB had linear correlations with CT imaging score, and they were dynamically changed during the disease progression and treatment.

Interpretation: Our findings provide the evidence that the CT imaging score can be used to reflect disease severity, and the multiple enzyme release, inflammation storm, and hypercoagulability are prominent indicators to monitor the changes of disease progression and prognosis of COVID-19, which are critical to explain the multiple organ injuries or death in clinic and also guide therapeutic strategy.

With respect to the cohort of patients with COVID-19 enrolled in our study, it is important to highlight that 74% of patients received enoxaparin 40 mg (4000 iu) subcutaneously once daily. In 12% of patients, the dose of enoxaparin was reduced to 20 mg once daily due to a weight of < 50 kg (8%) or renal impairment (4%). In all, 11% of our cohort were already on extended-duration therapeutic anticoagulation at time of presentation with COVID-19 for a variety of reasons (including atrial fibrillation, mitral valve replacement, and cancer-associated venous thromboembolism) and consequently were maintained on the same during their admissions. Finally, 2% of patients did not receive thromboprophylaxis due to perceived increased bleeding risks. Of particular importance in respect to the point raised by Marrietta
et al
.

, only one patient with COVID-19 actually received an enoxaparin dose of > 40 mg for thromboprophylaxis (due to increased body weight of > 100 kg). In summary therefore, the doses of LWMH used in our cohort are entirely consistent with best practice guidelines. In addition, none of our cohort developed any major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding complications.

On the basis of the literature to date, it is clear that severe COVID-19 infection is associated with a predominantly prothrombotic disorder rather than bleeding phenotype. Consequently, like many others in the field, we have significant concerns that standard dose thromboprophylaxis may be not be adequate for some patients with severe COVID-19, and in particular those who require intensive care unit support. This hypothesis is supported by emerging data suggesting that the incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 may be >30%, even in patients receiving LMWH thromboprophylaxis.

To date, we have not increased our standard LMWH thromboprophylaxis treatment for patients with COVID-19, although that decision is under constant review. From the literature, it is clear that other centres have already elected to institute increased LMWH doses for selected patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Although the numbers of patients reported to date remains small, the use of higher-dose LMWH has not been associated with increased bleeding (reviewed in Connors and Levy
9
). Thankfully, international trials have been established to compare the pros and cons of therapeutic-
versus
prophylactic-dose LMWH in patients with COVID-19.

As ever, a
one-size-fits-all
approach to anticoagulant therapy will not be applicable for all patients with severe COVID-19 infection. To develop personalised treatment regimes, further insights into the pathophysiology underpinning COVID-19 coagulopathy and vasculopathy are essential. Whether clinical scores [Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and/or Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC)] and/or coagulation biomarkers are useful in this setting remains to be defined. We agree entirely with Marrietta

is interesting and intuitively attractive. Additional studies will be necessary to dissect local thrombo-inflammatory responses induced by COVID-19 infection within the lungs. Nevertheless, with the tsunami of new COVID-19 data that continues to be published on a daily basis, it is already clear that the prothrombotic complications of severe COVID-19 are not confined to the microvasculature, or indeed to the lungs. Recent papers have described increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke in patients with COVID-19*

Moreover, evidence of COVID-19 vasculopathy involving the microvasculature in other tissues has also been described.
17
Further clinical trials and multivariate analyses will be required to establish whether the risk of arterial thrombosis is increased in COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, however, some unusual clinical features have been described with respect to the clinical presentations associated with these complications. For example, ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram has been reported in patients with COVID-19 who had no evidence of coronary artery obstruction on angiography, suggesting that other mechanisms may be contributing to myocardial injury.
13

15
Similarly, case reports suggest that ischaemic strokes in COVID-19 may involve multi-territory infarcts and even occur in patients already on therapeutic anticoagulation.
16
Notwithstanding these emerging data, the immuno-coagulopathic changes in severe COVID-19 certainly appear to be unusual in nature. Furthermore, given the findings from autopsy studies,

it seems probable that disseminated microvascular coagulopathy within the lungs plays an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

ABSTRACT

We read with interest your recent article by Fogarty et al, in particular their conclusion that differences in thrombotic risk may contribute to ethnic disparities in mortality from Covid-19.(1) This is especially important in the UK, where age-sex adjusted hospital death rates for Covid-19 are 2.17 times higher for people with ethnicity recorded as black compared to those recorded as white, and 1.95 higher for those recorded as Asian.(2) This excess mortality persists after adjustment for deprivation, body mass index (BMI), smoking and comorbidities,(2) and despite correction for region, rural or urban living, deprivation, household composition, socioeconomic status, and health.(3) Similar data from the USA shows that in 14 states, African-Americans represent 33% of hospitalisations for Covid-19, despite only making up 14% of the catchment population.(4) Black ethnicity is a construct incorporating diverse populations of African descent. Studies from several communities labelled as black, in particular African-Americans, imply a common increase in thrombotic risk, which may contribute to unexplained ethnic disparities in the UK and USA in Covid-19.

Background
Information on risk factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank.
Methods
UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes.
Findings
Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza.
Interpretation
These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic affecting millions around
the world. There is no existing pharmaceutical treatment that is known to be effective.
Preliminary data shows that San Yao San Fang (SYSF) has clinical benefits in patients with
COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to review existing data regarding the use of formulas
within San Yao San Fang in the treatment of COVID-19
Search Strategy: We searched through 5 databases for studies on SYSF and patients with
COVID-19 through April 2020.
Eligibility Criteria: We included studies that included formulas within San Yao San Fang
with or without Western interventions against Western interventions.
Main results: We included 7 studies involving 532 patients.
SYSF combined with Western interventions improved the recovery rate of symptoms such as
fever (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.40 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.66, P < 0.01)), cough (RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.38
to 0.82, P < 0.01)) and fatigue (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78, P < 0.01)) and other symptoms
such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, dyspnoea and chest tightness (RR 0.63
(95% CI 0.47 to 0.83, P < 0.01)) as compared to the control group.
SYSF combined with Western interventions reduced the duration of fever as compared to the
control group. (Mean difference (MD) -1.18 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.91, P < 0.01))
In regards to adverse events, there is no statistical difference between the treatment group and
the control group. (RR 1.62 (95% CI 0.83 to 3.17, P = 0.16)).
SYSF combined with Western interventions did not show to significantly reduce duration of
hospitalisation as compared to the control group. (MD -0.73 (95% CI -5.19 to 3.73, P = 0.75))
Conclusion: SYSF appears to be clinically effective and safe. Further research is required to
ensure the efficacy of SYSF.

As of April 24, 2020, there were 2 790 986 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 195 775 deaths worldwide, with the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Turkey, and Iran surpassing China in the number of confirmed cases.
1
In a consecutive series of 221 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, acute ischemic stroke occurred in 11(5%) of patients with a broad range of stroke subtypes.
2
These patients with stroke were older, more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, presenting with severe COVID-19 with multiple organ involvement. Of note, presence of COVID-19 in these patients does not imply that COVID-19 was the mechanism leading to the patient's stroke.

Shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks, facial shields, hand sanitizer, and cleansing wipes have presented a major challenge in the allocation of resources, as healthcare workers are frontline in the treatment of these patients.
3
Redeployment of clinical staff, nursing, stroke and neurocritical care specialists to care for patients with COVID-19 may create staffing shortages for dedicated stroke care.

In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 to neuroscience healthcare workers, their patients, and their families, and to optimize allocation of healthcare resources, we present a modified algorithm to acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke workflow in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance statement is based on shared best practices,
4-6
consensus among academic and nonacademic practicing vascular and interventional neurologists, literature review, and would be adapted to the available resources of a local institution. The patients with acute stroke are a vulnerable group to address because these patients often come emergently from the community with little information. Radical changes are felt to be necessary to optimize the safety of the providing team and our patients, limit unnecessary tests, conserve PPE resources and mechanical ventilator usage. This document divides into the following: prehospital phase to the Emergency Department (ED), prethrombectomy procedure, thrombectomy intraprocedure, and postreperfusion therapy phases (

Guidance Summary for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke in the Era of COVID-19

Prehospital care

Every patient with acute stroke (direct presenting to ED or in transfer) should be triaged for symptoms and signs of COVID-19, including potential contact.

If there is a positive screen, this patient should wear a surgical mask and be placed in isolation in a negative pressure room. If telecommunication (phone+-video) is available, it should be utilized. Identify the minimum number of providers needed to care for the patient and wear PPE for any patient contact.

If there is a positive pulmonary symptom, consider noncontrast chest CT at the same time as head and neck CT/CTA, provided this addition does not incur >5 min delay. Note, if a patient is received in transfer from another hospital or has already returned from radiology, chest CT should not be performed before reperfusion therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis nor thrombectomy.
*

A direct to angiography suite approach should be considered for stable patients with stroke symptoms onset within 24 h, who are transferred from other hospitals with time from last neuroimaging within 2 h and ASPECTS >=7.

Consent and health care proxy

If the patient is not consentable, the legally authorized representative (LAR) should consent for the patient. Two physician emergency consent should be obtained if the LAR is not available.

If the patient is consentable, perform verbal procedural consent with witness. Include consent for general anesthesia.

If the patient is consentable, perform verbal healthcare proxy consent with a witness.

Airway preparation

The anesthesiologist should be alerted early of a patient with COVID-19 or suspect patient.

Consider conscious sedation as first line if the patient is stable.

Discuss whether there should be dedicated COVID-19 glidescope ready in the angio suite in case the patient deteriorates.

In a patient who is considered at risk for airway deterioration (ie, orthopnea, tachypnea, or respiratory distress lying flat, high oxygen requirement), inability to protect airway, active vomiting, agitated or uncooperative, then early and controlled intubation is preferred.

Discuss where the patient gets intubated if they need intubation (ie, negative pressure room before coming to angio suite, or on the angio table).

Review in advance whether anesthesia presence is required in the room or as needed for intubation or hemodynamic issues.

Thrombectomy room preparation before patient arrival

Remove all unnecessary objects or items in the angio suite to minimize need for periop team for cleaning post procedure (ie, lead aprons that will not be utilized).

Cover countertop items with plastic or remove them.

Prepare all procedural elements in the room before patient arrival (ie, medications, devices, cover detector, pedals with plastic, bags, etc) to minimize time of the patient in the room, protect room equipment, and prevent breaking scrub.

Cover the cabinets of the supply closet before the patient enters the room.

Nonintubated, stable patients can be moved to a step-down unit with appropriate nursing expertise in the setting of a shortage or anticipated shortage of critical care beds.

Postprocedure neurological exam and access site checks should be performed by one provider and minimized to conserve PPE.

When the patient is handed off to the receiving team, have the gowned provider check the patient's neurological exam, vital signs, and/or access site before doffing their PPE. This can count as the 15- or 30-minute check post-procedure depending on the time that has elapsed.

If telecommunication/video can serve as a continuous monitor of the patient, it should be.

Otherwise, consider another neurological exam, vital sign, and/or access site check 15 or 30 min after hand-off, and then every hourx2. Thereafter, these combined checks can be q4h.

The frequency of combined neurological, vital sign, and/or access site checks should be adjusted depending on patient status (less if they are intubated and sedated), the patient's hemodynamic stability, and concern for access site bleeding.

Postthrombectomy therapy

There should be a 30-minute delay before perioperative clean staff clean the angio suite room to allow the room to air out.

The patient should be extubated in a negative pressure room once they meet criteria.

Postpone or delay all but absolutely necessary tests for the patient until they rule out for COVID-19 (to protect staff, protective gear, prevent virus trafficking).

Communication with family is important as visitation rights may be restricted. This can take place by telephone.

When rounding on the inpatient wards, patients on contact or droplet precaution should be seen at the end of rounds to avoid unintentional viral spread to patients not on precaution, assuming that these patients are medically stable.

If a provider develops symptoms of cough, fever, or shortness of breath, they should seek testing and potential quarantine based on local protocols.

Psychosocial intervention

When appropriate, an evaluation of a patient's mental health is important to alleviate the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for a patient in isolation with a new or recurrent diagnosis of stroke

Debrief to learn from each other and perform quality improvement.

Postacute care

Consider testing for COVID-19 if not already done in a patient being transitioned to a postacute care facility to facilitate transitions of care.

Prehospital and ED Care of Acute Large Vessel Occlusion

Adhering to existing local protocols, all patients (including stroke) presenting to the ED or as interhospital transfers, are screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Any patient who is COVID-19 positive or screen positive should be managed under local protocols to ensure both patient and staff safety. Use of remote telestroke technology should be considered to obtain history and perform neurological examination, if available. During a Code Stroke, coordination between team members with predefined assigned roles (ie, one team member in PPE with patient, another member talks to family over telephone, looks at images, laboratories, and orders thrombolysis or medications) will help reduce staff exposure while maintaining quality care.

If there is positive screening for COVID-19, this patient should wear a surgical mask and immediately be placed in a negative pressure room in the ED if one is available.
7
A test for COVID-19 should be considered if the patient meets local criteria for investigation. If a patient or their family is unable to provide corroborative history, then a surgical mask should be placed on this patient, the patient tested for COVID-19 and precautions in place.

Team members evaluating acute stroke code patients in person should be kept to a minimum (ie, one physician, one nurse) and wear appropriate PPE including full sleeved gown, surgical mask, eye protection (face shield or equivalent), and gloves.
8
Personal protection should be escalated to N95 mask, hair cap, double gloves, shoe covers in the setting of contact with patient with confirmed COVID-19 and/or aerosolizing events such as coughing, sneezing, nebulizer treatment, suctioning, nasogastric tube placement, bag mask ventilation, CPR, and intubation.

A dedicated computed tomography (CT) scan room for patients with COVID-19 should be established if multiple CT rooms are available. If there are positive pulmonary symptoms, consider low-dose chest CT at the same time as the performance of CT head with CT angiography head and neck, as long as the addition of the chest CT does not incur >5-minute delay to treatment. CT chest may facilitate COVID-19 diagnosis.
9
,
10
However, decision-making to test a patient for COVID-19 or about need for quarantine should be based on local protocols. Of note, if a patient had a head CT/CT angiography at an outside hospital or has returned to the ER from head CT/CT angiography, repeat CT to evaluate for chest pathology should not be performed before reperfusion therapy or thrombectomy.

If CT perfusion is part of an institution's protocol for selection of thrombectomy patients in the late window, it should be performed at the same time as CT head and CT angiography. Recent data suggest that in the 6- to 24-hour time window, clinical core mismatch by Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) (6-10) on noncontrast CT overlaps with clinical core mismatch by CT perfusion or MRI using DAWN criteria
11
in nearly 80% of cases.
12
Given the overwhelming benefit of thrombectomy noted in DAWN, it is reasonable to assume that meaningful benefit from thrombectomy exists when imaging criteria defining the clinical core mismatch in DAWN are substituted by ASPECTS scores on noncontrast CT. Lack of CT perfusion or MRI capabilities in a resource constrained environment should not be a deterrent from thrombectomy in the 6- to 24-hour time window.

As it would minimize exposure to emergency department and CT suite personnel, a direct to the angiography suite approach should be considered for stable transferred patients with stroke symptoms onset within 24 hours, particularly if the time from the outside hospital imaging to arrival is <2 hours and CT ASPECTS is >=7. This approach has been shown to safely reduce times to reperfusion and may lead to better functional outcomes.

Airway Preparation

The anesthesiologist should be alerted early of a COVID-19 or suspect patient. Local policies for intubation and general anesthesia versus conscious sedation differ at different centers. If appropriate, consider conscious sedation as first-line to protect anesthesiologists from exposure and to protect our patients from unnecessary intubation as well as conserving mechanical ventilator resources.
14
,
15
Converting a patient from conscious sedation to general anesthesia in the middle of the procedure in the angiography suite should be avoided due to high risk of aerosolization in a positive pressure room. In a patient who is considered at risk for airway deterioration (ie, orthopnea, tachypnea, or respiratory distress lying flat, high oxygen requirement), unable to protect their airway, agitation, uncooperative, or actively vomiting, then early and controlled intubation is preferred. An aerosol box can be used as a cover as an additional measure of PPE protection during intubation.
16
High-flow oxygen, bag-valve mask, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation are not recommended due to the concern for aerosolization of virus. Rapid sequence intubation may be the preferred course.

There should be a discussion regarding where the patient gets intubated if it is seen necessary (ie, in a negative pressure room in the ED, operating theater, ICU versus angiography suite). If no negative pressure room is immediately available, the treatment plans should continue forward. Any breach in the ventilator tubing should be avoided, which can be a source for aerosolization and exposure to health care workers.

If the decision is for conscious sedation, consideration for a dedicated COVID-19 glidescope or video laryngoscopy can be prepared in the angiography suite in case the patient deteriorates. Advance discussion on whether the anesthesiologist is required in the angiography suite during the case should be reviewed or as needed for intubation or hemodynamic support. If the patient requires intubation in the angiography suite, all nonessential persons should leave the room. Following intubation, any person entering the room should be in full PPE because of concern for residual aerosolization of virus post intubation.

Procedural Consent and Health Care Proxy

If the patient is unable to consent, a legally authorized representative should consent for the patient. If no contact can be reached, 2-physician emergency consent may be obtained or the proper documentation for the treatment risks and benefits and the failed attempts to contact family can be made in the medical record as per local institutional protocols.

If the patient is consentable, it is preferable to have a patient verbally authorize staff to sign the consent form for them. Inanimate objects such as pens and tablets can become a vehicle of spread for COVID-19. This may be considered appropriate in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, local standards should be adhered to. The staff assistant would sign the patient's name and document themselves as witness in the presence of the patient. If the patient declines directed signature, they should be provided a new pen and sign the form.

At the same time, as the procedural consent, consent for general anesthesia should be obtained.

In a consentable patient, designation of a healthcare proxy consent should be conducted with a staff witness in the event the patient loses the ability to provide informed consent. This step may be important because rehabilitation or long-term care facilities may require this document to accept a candidate patient.

Preprocedure Room Preparation

The charge nurse and technologist should be alerted as soon as there is a suspected or patient with confirmed COVID-19 patient and room preparation dependent on the institution. If there are multiple angiography rooms available, a COVID-19 room can be designated. The procedure room should be cleared of any unnecessary items (ie, lead aprons that will not be utilized) to minimize the need of perioperative staff cleaning post-procedure. Countertop items should be covered with plastic or removed. The detectors on the angiography suite, foot pedal, and lead shields should be covered in plastic or an equivalent. The hanging lead shields and standing lead shields can be used as another layer of protection for the proceduralist.

The table, medications, and procedural preparation should be made in advance as much as possible to improve speed to reperfusion, limit the time the patient is in the suite, limit the need to break in and out of the room to retrieve materials or break scrub. The cabinets of the supply materials should be covered before the patient comes in the room.

There should be a designated space for the proceduralist phone and/or pager in the control room and communication maintained with the proceduralist via intercom or walkie-talkie if there is an urgent call.

If circumstances allow, it is optimal to have an observer ensure proper donning of gown and protective gear by each member in the procedure room per institutional protocol. This should include double gloving, wearing a face mask that covers the eyes, N95 mask in COVID-19 suspected patients, and wearing shoe covers.

There should be hand sanitizer stations near the doors entering or exiting the angio suite room as well as in patient recovery areas.

Thrombectomy Intraprocedure

In the procedure, staff should be kept to a minimum (ie, 1 nurse, 1 technologist, 1 physician) to limit provider exposure and limit use of protective gear. Door entry to the angiography suite should be taped with a sign to prevent people from entering inadvertently without protective gear. Most angiography suites are positive pressure rooms. Opening any doors to the angiography suite should be minimized once the patient is in the room to prevent movement of the virus to adjacent spaces.

In the control room, consider limiting the number of people to maintain a 6-foot distance between team members. These persons should wear a mask if the door between the angio suite and control room is opened because the angiography suite is likely to be a positive pressure room and can contaminate the adjacent rooms.

Negative or even fluid balance should be maintained given the risk for pulmonary edema in patients with COVID-19. Heparinized bag flushes should be monitored closely to ensure inadvertent excess fluid administration. Blood loss should be minimized given concurrent national shortages of blood.

After the procedure is completed, discuss with the admitting team and draw blood tests from the sheath that may be necessary for COVID-19 and stroke workup if not already done (ie, arterial blood gas, complete blood count, Chem 7, creatine kinase, and hypercoagulable panel in younger patients, B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin, hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol panel, etc) to limit the need for additional blood draws and exposures.

Cone-beam head CT (Xper or Dyna) should be considered while the patient is on the angiography suite table post-procedure to obviate the need for travel to CT, with the caveat of limited quality.

Ensure any trash is completely inside the trash bag.

If the room is big enough, place red tape on the floor of the angio suite 6 feet from the patient's bed. This would be the area outside of which a provider would doff their gown. Again, an observer to watch team members doff off their gown and gear can be helpful to identify potential contamination or technique mistakes, if available.

Nonintubated, stable patients can be moved to a step-down unit with appropriate nursing expertise in the setting of a shortage or anticipated shortage of critical care beds.
6
Repatriation or transfer of a patient post-thrombectomy from a comprehensive stroke center to a primary stroke center with appropriate physician and nursing expertise can be considered in the setting of hospitals overwhelmed by a shortage of ventilators or critical care beds while maintaining thrombectomy access. Communication between transferring and receiving teams, advance notification to patient families of repatriation is important to maintain optimal patient care.

Postprocedure or postthrombolytic neurological exam and/or access site checks should be combined and performed by one person and the frequency minimized to conserve PPE. When the patient is handed off to the receiving team, have the provider check the neurological exam, vitals, and/or access site before doffing their gown. This can qualify as the 15- or 30-minute check post-procedure or post thrombolytic, depending on the time that has elapsed.

Video can be utilized as a continuing monitor of the patient's neurological exam and/or access site. Otherwise, consider another combined exam, vital sign, and/or access site check 15 or 30 minutes after hand-off, and then every hourx2. Thereafter, if the patient has remained stable, the intervals for the combined checks can be spread to q4h. The frequency of checks should be adjusted depending on the patient's status (less if they are intubated and sedated), hemodynamic stability, perceived risk of hemorrhagic transformation, and concern for bleeding at the access site.

Post-Procedure

There should be a minimum 30 minutes delay before perioperative cleaning staff cleans the angiography suite to allow the room to air out.
7

In-room providers should wash their hands, sanitize, and change out their scrubs or follow local protocol. Telephone communication with the patient's family should then be pursued as with any reperfusion therapy or procedure, but even more so with the COVID-19 pandemic and restriction of family/visitors.

Intubated patients should be extubated in a negative pressure room.

A definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made as soon as possible as patients who rule out will decrease the use of protective equipment.
7
Any tests that do not change management should be delayed or deferred (to protect staff, virus trafficking, and conserve protective gear).
7

Imaging of COVID-19 or suspected patients should be limited to imaging that will impact management.
17

When rounding, the usual sequence is by acuity of patient illness or geographic convenience. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, assuming that all patients are equally stable, patients on contact or droplet precaution should be rounded on at the end of rounds to avoid unintentional viral spread to patients not on precautions as clinical circumstances allow.

If a provider develops any symptoms of cough, fever, or shortness of breath, they should seek testing and potential quarantine based on local protocols.

Psychosocial Intervention

When appropriate, an evaluation of a patient's mental health is important to alleviate the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 epidemic for a patient in isolation with a new or recurrent diagnosis of stroke.
18

It is helpful to debrief with the team to learn, improve best practices and workflow. Healthcare workers, particularly nurses and frontline healthcare workers directly engaged in the care of patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to the psychological burden of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress.
19

Postacute Care

In preparation for the patient's postacute care, testing for COVID-19 may be required for a patient being discharged to a postacute care facility, regardless of whether the patient was being treated for COVID-19 at the hospital.
20
Patients who are asymptomatic or with minor signs of infection have been shown capable of shedding potentially infectious virus.
21
Long- or short-term care facilities are vulnerable to respiratory disease outbreaks, including the spread of COVID-19.
22
Early coordinated communication between the primary team, case management, and postacute care facilities is important to reduce bottlenecks in patient transitions once the patient is medically ready.

Conclusions

We live in uncharted times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The word crisis in Chinese is composed of 2 characters, one representing danger, the other opportunity. We cannot see this dangerous enemy, the coronavirus. Every opportunity and detail to recalibrate our acute neurological workflow to protect our frontline healthcare workers, our families, our colleagues, and our patients should be sought, implemented, and adapted to a resource-constrained environment. It is incumbent upon us to protect each other so that we are not unknowingly exposed or spread to our most vulnerable patients, while at the same time, providing optimal care, patient safety, and access for our patients with stroke. Optimizing protection of the healthcare worker should not compromise emergency stroke patient care. This guidance statement pertains to current practice and can change as new evidence arises.

Abstract

COVID-19 is associated with a systemic inflammatory response with activation of coagulation in symptomatic patients. The possibility of coagulopathies in peri- and postmenopausal women taking estrogen therapies makes it necessary to consider antithrombotic strategies, such as the use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) at specific prophylactic or treatment doses for each individual case, depending on the risk factors that each woman presents.

For such reasons, a panel of experts from various Spanish scientific societies has met to develop usage recommendations for managing menopausal women taking menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or combined hormonal contraception (CHC) during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Subjects

We are currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The global shutdown, with more than a third of the world's population facing some form of lockdown or quarantine measures, is on an unprecedented scale and will no doubt be etched in history. At the time of writing, more than 2 million people have been diagnosed to have the infection, with more than 50,000 deaths worldwide. It is expected that an even larger number are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and undiagnosed.

During this time, while the world's focus is on the novel coronavirus, there is a danger that other illnesses might be overlooked. Members of the public are being urged not to attend emergency departments for non-urgent matters, with the dual intention of protecting healthcare workers whilst freeing resources to treat the COVID-19 patients. Indeed, hospitals have reported a decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments with myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents [
1
,
2
]. It is likely that patients are concerned about contracting the virus while attending the hospital and are staying away, as there are reports of delayed presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarctions [
3
]. It is imperative that these other life-threatening conditions are not forgotten while we deal with the coronavirus.

In addition to the acute conditions, management of stable chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes may also be affected. Many hospitals worldwide have cancelled all in-person elective patient care, including routine outpatient clinics, and moved towards telemedicine as part of social distancing measures. Doing so also preserves resources to help tackle supply chain problems and other challenges created by a surge in patients infected by the novel coronavirus. Even in these circumstances, it is important that blood pressure and blood glucose levels are monitored regularly. This is particularly important as patients with diabetes and hypertension may be at higher risk for complications of COVID-19 [
4
].

Early data from China and the United States suggest that hypertension appears to be the most prevalent comorbidity among patients admitted with COVID-19 being present in at least 30-49% of them [
4
,
5
]. Hypertensive patients who develop COVID-19 are more likely to be admitted to hospital than normotensive individuals [
6
]. The presence of hypertension also seems to be associated with poorer outcomes from COVID-19 [
7
]. It not clear whether it is hypertension per se that contributes to the increased morbidity, or whether patients with hypertension have more underlying health problems, as data have confirmed that patients with multiple comorbidities are likely to fare worse [
8
]. We should bear in mind though, that these are retrospective data from patients admitted with COVID-19 and therefore can only suggest association and not causation. Nevertheless, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus with ACE2 in the endothelial cell [
9
] does raise the possibility that endothelial dysfunction, which commonly occurs in hypertension [
10
], may exacerbate the effect of the virus.

A major problem during a pandemic with a hitherto-unknown organism is early conflicting data that can cause uncertainty and confusion in the management of these patients. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor [
9
] thereby gaining entry to the cells. Concern was therefore raised at the start of the pandemic that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), medications that are commonly used for hypertension and heart failure, could have a potential deleterious effect [
11
], as ACE2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system and is up regulated by these drugs in some tissues in a subset of animal models [
12
,
13
]. These initial publications led to a considerable amount of discussion and debate with the counter argument being that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to protect from lung injury in experimental models of coronavirus infections [
14
]. These agents have also previously been demonstrated to reduce systemic inflammation and could potentially reduce the degree of multi-organ failure seen in severe COVID-19 [
15
]. It was also considered that uncontrolled blood pressure or heart failure that could ensue as a result of discontinuation of these therapies and could contribute to morbidity in infected patients. Guidance was promptly issued advising that these drugs not be discontinued [
16
,
17
]. Subsequent data have raised the possibility that patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs do indeed have a better outcome, with the crucial caveat that the possibility of unmeasured confounding and bias precludes drawing cause-effect conclusions from the clinical studies available thus far. A recent retrospective study from China comparing outcomes on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension has suggested that in the former all-cause mortality was lower (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92;
P
= 0.03) [
18
]. Another retrospective study from China showed that fewer patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs had severe disease as compared with those who were not on these drugs (23.5% and 48%, respectively). The ACE inhibitor/ARB-treated group also had significantly higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cells and a trend towards lower IL-6 levels [
19
] More recent analyses (preprints), though, have suggested that after adjustment for certain likely confounders, the signal for improved outcomes is no longer as strong as first believed [
20
]. In the end, the effects of treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs will only be positively identified through RCTs, which are ongoing [
21
].

There is also mounting concern about possible thromboembolic complications of the virus and a possible procoagulable state [
22
]. Various factors which can lead to a hypercoagulable state such as inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation, dehydration and diffuse intravascular coagulation have been described in COVID-19. In addition, hypertension has also known to be associated with a hypercoagulable state [
23
] and it is possible that an interaction between these two conditions might lead to a worsening thrombotic milieu.

We are still learning more about this new virus and information continues to mount. In the meantime, it would be prudent to continue the guideline-based management of all chronic conditions and cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. Healthcare practitioners need to ensure that patients are appropriately advised and have access to their drugs. Patients should be made aware that despite the lockdown, pharmacies and hospitals are still open. Indeed the British heart foundation has recently issued a notice reminding the public not to ignore chest pain and seek help immediately, as they also report a 50% drop in patients presenting with a myocardial infarction since the start of the pandemic [
22
]. General practitioners and family physicians are still available for consultations, even if it is over the telephone. Patients should also be encouraged to monitor their blood pressure at home, be adherent with treatment, and adopt healthy lifestyles. In many countries, individuals are allowed to go out to exercise, while ensuring they maintain social distancing and take all the other necessary precautions as advised by their public health authorities.

This current pandemic has brought about profound changes in the social and economic lives of many. It has also changed the way healthcare is being delivered and prioritised. Even when social restrictions are relaxed, it is hard to imagine that things would quickly (if ever) go back to how they were before the pandemic. Whilst we get used to the new ""normal"" way of life, we should remember that other diseases and illness are still out there and still need our care. Perhaps this is a time for much of the control of chronic illnesses to go back to the community and the patients. We have to ensure that patients with chronic illnesses are not forgotten in our fight against SARS-CoV-2 and do not end up as collateral damage."

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has posed unparalleled challenges for health care communities, the general population, and in particular, for patients suffering from various comorbidities. Patients with hematological disorders, both benign and malignant need special attention during this crisis time to ensure uninterrupted delivery of optimal care (Sahu & Siddiqui, 2020).

Abstract

The month of Ramadan forms one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith. Adult Muslims are obligated to keep daily fasts from dawn to sunset, with exceptions. This year Ramadan is due to begin on 23 April 2020 and the longest fast in the UK will be approximately 18 hours in length. In addition, due to the often high-calorie meals eaten to break the fast, Ramadan should be seen as a cycle of fasting and feasting. Ramadan fasting can impact those with diabetes, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and dehydration. This year, Ramadan will occur during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reports show that diabetes appears to be a risk factor for more severe disease with COVID-19. In addition, the UK experience has shown diabetes and COVID-19 is associated with dehydration, starvation ketosis, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state. This makes fasting in Ramadan particularly challenging for those Muslims with diabetes. Here, we discuss the implications of fasting in Ramadan during the COVID-19 pandemic and make recommendations for those with diabetes who wish to fast.

Summary

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but about 5% develop severe symptoms, which can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Kidney involvement is frequent, with clinical presentation ranging from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT). An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in the setting of critical illness and COVID-19 is emerging, although further research is needed to identify patients at risk of AKI and to guide management strategies. As no specific treatment options exist for AKI secondary to COVID-19, intensive care is largely supportive. Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19. International collaborative and cross-disciplinary research is needed to obtain adequate evidence to support current clinical approaches and to develop new approaches to management."

Abstract

Background and purpose

On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 infection a pandemic. The risk of ischemic stroke may be higher in patients with COVID-19 infection similar to those with other respiratory tract infections. We present a comprehensive set of practice implications in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.

Methods

The practice implications were prepared after review of data to reach the consensus among stroke experts from 18 countries. The writers used systematic literature reviews, reference to previously published stroke guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate practice implications. All members of the writing group had opportunities to comment in writing on the practice implications and approved the final version of this document.

Results

This document with consensus is divided into 18 sections. A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed. The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Conclusions

These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection. Under certain circumstances, however, only limited evidence is available to support these practice implications, suggesting an urgent need for establishing procedures for the management of stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 27 April 2020, a total of 3,064,895 patients had been diagnosed globally, with 211,609 deaths. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed fever, cough, and/or dyspnea. Pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac injury, renal failure, and encephalitis
1
have been reported. Some patients do have Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke as their initial presentation. A comprehensive document providing up-to-date data and guidance to healthcare providers involved in management of acute stroke is needed to meet the new challenges to acute stroke care posed by COVID-19 pandemic.

To develop a comprehensive document, panel members from 18 countries were identified on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas. Preference was given to members from countries with large proportion of COVID-19 infected patients and those from countries with previous corona virus infection outbreaks such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The panel used systematic literature reviews using key words ""COVID-19,"" AND ""corona virus,"" OR ""stroke,"" AND ""cerebrovascular disease"" from 1 November 2019 to 5 April 5 2020. Additional reference to previously published stroke guidelines, WHO, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, relevant non-stroke-related professional guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion were made (see supplemental material for literature reviewed). The report summarized existing evidence, indicated gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulated practice implications.

Section 1. Acute stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection

A single center study of 221 consecutive hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection reported that 11 (5%) developed acute ischemic stroke, 1 (0*5%) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and 1 (0*5%) cerebral hemorrhage.
2
The mean age of patients who developed stroke (72 years) was higher (52 years) and the stroke group had higher frequency of hepatic and renal dysfunction. The frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous history of cerebrovascular disease were higher among those who developed stroke. The median duration from first symptoms of COVID-19 infection to stroke was 10 days (interquartile range 1-29 days). Of the 11 patients with ischemic stroke, five were related to large artery disease, three small artery disease, and three cardioembolic events. The fibrin D-dimer levels were 12-fold higher in patients who developed stroke indicating a hypercoagulable state. Of 11 patients with ischemic stroke, 6 received antiplatelet treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel, and 5 received anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin. The overall mortality rate was 38.5% (5/13); 50% and 20% in those treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant, respectively. Another study reported occurrence of cerebrovascular disease in 5 (5.7%) of 88 patients with severe COVID-19 infection and 1 (1%) of 126 patients with mild infection.
3
,
4
Cerebrovascular events were more common in older patients with stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and those who had elevated fibrin D-dimers.
2
,
3

The proportion of COVID-19 infected patients who are expected to have acute stroke is 4.9% (95% confidence interval: no continuity correction 2.8%-8.7%).
2
The estimated number ranges between 7820 and 35,867 under the assumption that 1,329,877 patients are infected as of 6 April 2020, and an estimated 21% to 31% of COVID-19 infected patients requiring hospitalization. There is a possibility that COVID-19 infection increases the risk of stroke because the risk is increased 3.2 to 7.82 folds within first three days after other respiratory tract infections.
5
,
6
If the risk of stroke is increased with COVID-19 infection, an increase in number of acute strokes can be expected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, the number of patients with transient ischemic attack and minor stroke presenting to hospital may decrease as those patients may avoid hospitalization.

Conclusion and practice implications

Patients with COVID-19 infection carry a high risk of developing acute stoke especially in those with multiple organ dysfunctions.

It remains unclear as to the underlying cause of developing acute stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection. There is preliminary evidence of hyper coagulopathy in association with increased risk of developing stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection. An increased risk of acute ischemic stroke has also been noted in patients with other respiratory tract infections.

Further studies should be undertaken to assess the risk of acute ischemic stroke which is likely increased in patients with COVID-19 infections and to establish evidence of increased stroke incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.
7

Section 2. Risk to stroke team members

Healthcare providers in contact with patients who have confirmed or possible COVID-19 infections have an increased risk of exposure to this virus. Basic principles of transmission and protection against transmission are summarized in
Table 2
and
Figure 1
. A Chinese report concluded that 3300 health-care workers have been infected as of early March with 22 deaths.
8
The Chinese Center of Disease Control and Prevention reported that 1716 (3.8%) of 44,672 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections were healthcare workers with highest occurrence reported in Wuhan before precautionary measures were taken.
9
In Italy, as of 15 March 2020, there had been 2026 documented COVID-19 cases among healthcare providers.
10

Conclusion and practice implications

Healthcare providers engaged in acute stroke care are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection from stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.

The exact risk of COVID-19 infection transmission during acute stroke care has not been established. It is likely that the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection is lower among providers taking care of acute stroke than those who are involved in evaluation of respiratory or infectious diseases and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.

Section 3. Types of COVID-19 infected stroke patients

The stroke team may be involved in evaluation of three categories of patients:

Patients with known COVID-19 infection

The current data suggest that patients with COVID-19 infection developed stroke in advanced stages of COVID-19 infection. The median duration from first symptoms of COVID-19 to the development of stroke was 10 days in one study.
2
Therefore, whether the patients are being evaluated in the emergency department (ED) or within the hospital, the institutional screening protocols would have already identified COVID-19 infection in these patients.

Patients with suspected COVID-19 infection

Almost all institutional screening protocols are based on the recommendations of WHO and CDC (
Table 1
). One of the challenges in identifying COVID-19 infection in acute stroke patients is an inability to get an accurate history of clinical symptoms due to underlying aphasia, dysarthria, and confusion. Cognitive incompetency and lack of availability of next of kin together are seen in 10%-12% of acute stroke patients depending upon stroke severity.
11
,
12
Some of the disease features, such as fever and cough are seen in 44% and 68% of the patients, respectively on admission.
13
Radiographic or computed tomography (CT) chest abnormalities may be found in 82% of the COVID-19 infected patients on admission.
14

The time constraints for confirming a COVID-19 infection need to be understood. Confirmation of COVID-19 infection requires detection of unique sequences of virus RNA using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. The time required to get the results vary depending upon what kit is being used (5 min to 8 h for rRT-PCR and three days for serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) and whether the specimen has to be sent to a laboratory outside the hospital. Repeat testing may be necessary due to poor quality of the specimen, limited patient specimens, the inappropriate timing of specimen collection (to early or too late) during the infection process.

Patients with undiagnosed COVID-19 infection

Acute stroke patients may be asymptomatic carriers, in the prodromal period, or neurological deficits is the first manifestation. The time between transmission and symptoms onset ranges between 2 and 14 days.
15
The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, highlighting the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients.
16
The estimated asymptomatic patient proportion ranges between 17.9% to 30.8% of all infected patients.
17
,
18
The possibility of isolated neurological symptoms as presenting symptoms in COVID-19 infected patient such as confusion (8%), headache (8-13%) and dizziness (17%) may prompt a stroke evaluation.
3

Conclusion and practice implications

COVID-19 infected patients may develop stroke after the diagnosis of infection had already been made. This sequence of events is consistent with acute stroke seen in the setting of other respiratory tract infections.

A COVID-19 infection is unlikely to be confirmed or excluded using laboratory assessment during the time frame for initial evaluation and decision making in acute stroke patients. Therefore, a clinically suspected COVID-19 infected patient with stroke has to be evaluated under the assumption that the patient has COVID-19 infection.

There is a possibility that acute stroke patients may have undiagnosed COVID-19 infection because: 1. Appropriate screening was not possible due to inadequate history from patient, due to stroke-related neurological deficits and lack of relatives; 2. Patients with COVID-19 infection being in prodromal period; 3. Patient is an asymptomatic carrier; and 4. Neurological deficits seen in early period of COVID-19 infection prompting a stroke evaluation.

If a stroke patient is suspected to have COVID-19 infection, pulmonary imaging using chest computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or radiograph may be helpful in identifying radiological abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19 infection.

The principles of transmission and protection are summarized in
Table 1
and
Figure 1
. Published data
19
show that SARS-CoV-2 virus maybe present and can survive in droplet nuclei up to 3 h. However, the contribution of droplet nuclei in transmission is currently uncertain. Standard surgical masks may not be effective in preventing inhalation of droplet nuclei because they are not designed to provide a tight face seal and to filter out particulates in the droplet nuclei. Particulate filtering facepiece respirator which include N95 (United States), FFP2 (Europe), KN95 (China), P2 (Australia/New Zealand), K94 (Korea KMOEL), or DS (Japan) are preferable. Using surgical mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing was effective in the prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003
20
with no superiority demonstrated for particulate filtering facepiece respirator.
21
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with COVID-19
22
recommend a minimum of a surgical/medical mask for healthcare providers caring for non-ventilated COVID-19 infected patients and during performance of non-aerosol-generating procedures on mechanically ventilation (closed circuit). The risk for severe COVID-19 infection may be higher in healthcare providers with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic renal disease.
4
,
9

One of the unique aspects of evaluation of acute stroke is that such evaluation can be performed remotely using Telestroke; and several guidelines identify Telestroke as an integral part of stroke systems of care.
23
,
24
Telestroke has demonstrated equivalence to that of a bedside assessment
23
,
24
for immediate assessment of stroke severity using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and to determine intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and/or thrombectomy eligibility.
23
,
24
Use of the low-cost smartphone application system is another option for the rapid clinical assessment in acute stroke care.
25

Conclusion and practice implications

Members of stroke team must use basic principles targeting prevention of disease transmission, including maintaining a distance of 2 m from patient (unless absolutely necessary) and combining the use of surgical mask, gloves, gowns, and handwashing. Whether a particulate filtering facepiece respirator is necessary is not clear as stroke evaluation does not require aerosol-generating procedures. The use of particulate filtering facepiece respirator may depend upon availability, institutional policy, and regional prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The stroke team evaluating the patient should comprise of the minimum number of healthcare providers and those who meet the high-risk criteria of contracting COVID-19 infection should preferably not be involved in the evaluation of stroke patients.

The most effective strategy to avoid transmission is by not being in the same room or space with a stroke patient with suspected or confirm COVID-19 infection. The use of Telestroke must be maximized in the current situation because all aspects of acute stroke evaluation can be performed. Institutions may explore with the ethics committee or Institutional Review Board whether commercially available low-cost smartphone application systems can substitute when Telestroke networks are not available.

Section 5. Environmental contamination

Centralized air conditioning may re-circulate viral materials in droplets from patients to unaffected individual and care providers due to inward direction of airflow.
26
SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in other body fluids such as fecal specimens of infected patients.
27
Significant contamination (SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA)
28
from patients was seen in air samples and surface samples from personal items (spirometer, pulse oximeter, nasal cannula), personal computers, iPads and reading glasses), room surfaces, and toilets. Viral RNA was also identified in bedside tables and beds, window ledges, and the floor beneath patients' beds.

Conclusion and practice implications

To avoid contamination of the environment and exposure to staff, it is advisable to create a stroke green pathway (including consultation rooms, CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rooms, and angiographic suite) that is separated from potentially contaminated ED to avoid direct interaction between the stroke team and patients with COVID-19 infection. The stroke green pathway can be based on a pre-hospitalization screening.

In the case of a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, an ad hoc pathway must be followed and the environment must be sanitized. The suspected or ascertained case must then be admitted in an isolation ward after treatment (suspected cases should be kept separated from the confirmed), in isolation room with precautions against transmission.

Section 6. Overall management plan for acute stroke patient

A management algorithm is summarized in
Figure 2
. The mortality was very high (38%) in stroke patients with COVID-19 infections.
2
The mortality was much higher than the mortality observed for hospitalized stroke patients in China ranging from 1.5 to 2.3% for ischemic stroke and 2.3-3.2% for all strokes.
29
Therefore, the outcome of patients with COVID-19 infection and stroke is heavily determined by the severity of underlying COVID-19 infection. The mortality rates among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection without stroke range from 22% to 45%.
4
,
30
,
31
Several factors in patients with COVID-19 infection have been established which can identify the patients at risk for in-hospital mortality such as older age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, cardiovascular diseases, secondary infections, ARDS, acute renal injury, and laboratory findings of lymphopenia and elevated hepatic enzymes, C reactive protein, ferritin, creatinine phosphokinase, and fibrin D-dimers.
4
,
30
-
32

Therefore, assessment of dysfunction in other organs using validated systems such as SOFA appears to be important to provide overall prognosis prior to determining the appropriate acute stroke treatment. The SOFA assesses respiration (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), coagulation (platelet count strata), hepatic enzymes (bilirubin concentration strata), cardiovascular (hypotension and treatment), neurological function (Glasgow Coma Scale/Score strata), renal (serum creatinine/urine output strata), and sepsis (present/absent) and assigns a score of 0-4. The mortality rates range from 3.2% in patients without organ failure to 91.3% in patients with failure of all the six organs analyzed in patients with sepsis.
33

Conclusion and practice implications

The high rate of mortality in COVID-19 infected patients who have multiple organ dysfunctions/failure needs to be recognized and is unlikely to be influenced from acute treatment of stroke. An assessment of the magnitude of organ dysfunction using SOFA score maybe helpful in delineating the overall care paradigm in acute stroke patients in accord with the expected prognosis in addition to stroke-related factors.

Section 7. Neurovascular imaging

Current guidelines for acute stroke management
34
recommend that all suspected stroke patients should receive brain imaging (non-contrast CT scan) on arrival to hospital preferably within 20 min of arrival in the ED. Patients in whom mechanical thrombectomy is being contemplated may require CT angiography and patients presenting between 6 and 24 h may require CT perfusion, or multimodal MRI. Current guidelines
34
recommend to proceed with contrast imaging prior to acquiring serum creatinine concentration in patients without a history of renal impairment. Both COVID-19 infection and stroke carry a high probability of renal impairment and perhaps higher probability when both occur together.
35
Contrast exposure required for CT angiography and perfusion images may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) in a highly vulnerable COVID-19 infected patient and increase risk of mortality.

Negative pressure carrier isolators have been used to isolate the patient during neurovascular imaging. The isolator consists of non-porous vinyl material that encapsulates the patient and the negative pressure and the outlet filters prevent contaminated air to escape from the isolator. Concurrent chest CT scan may be obtained at the time of neurovascular imaging may identify CT chest abnormalities (consolidation, ground glass opacity and reticular opacity in the presence of architectural distortion) that may be seen in up to 82% of patients with COVID-19 infection on admission.
13

Conclusion and practice implications

The relatively high rate of renal insufficiency with subsequent AKI in patients with COVID-19 infection needs to be recognized. Renal insufficiency and/or AKI increase the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection and those with stroke. It is reasonable to ascertain the presence of other risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with COVID-19 infection prior to administration of contrast for CT angiography and/or perfusion to appropriately identify the risk benefit ratio.

The purpose of CT angiography and perfusion images is to select patients for mechanical thrombectomy and can be avoided if mechanical thrombectomy is not going to be considered due to poor patient condition or patient/family wishes.

Concurrent pulmonary imaging using chest CT scan for identifying radiological abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19 infection may be incorporated as part of initial imaging in patients with acute stroke. The extent of pulmonary involvement may impact the therapeutic decisions in acute stroke management including the need for intubation. However, chest CT scan may be normal in the early phase of COVID-19 infection.

Negative pressure carrier isolators may be used to isolate patient with COVID-19 infection during neurovascular imaging.

Section 8. Intravenous thrombolysis

Intravenous rt-PA is recommended for selected patients who may be treated within 3 h and for highly selected patients who can be treated within 3 and 4.5 h of symptom onset or last known well.
34
Current guidelines do not recommend treatment with intravenous rt-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke and infective endocarditis, because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
34
There are no septic emboli generated in COVID-19 infection but perhaps a generalized pro-coagulable state similar to sepsis may exist. Patients with sepsis and systemic inflammatory response can be either hypercoagulable or hypocoagulable.
36
Leukocytosis (with lymphocytopenia), with elevation in neutrophil counts, the level of C reactive protein, and fibrin D-dimers, a fibrin degradation product, have been identified in patients with COVID-19 infection.
13
Previous studies in patients without COVID-19 infection have demonstrated a higher rate of death
35
or more severe disability and higher risk of ICH among ischemic stroke patients with leukocytosis, elevated levels of C reactive protein,
37
and fibrin D dimers
38
who were treated with intravenous rt-PA.

Another aspect to consider is hepatic dysfunction manifested by elevation in the transaminases level in patients with COVID-19 infection.
13
Intravenous rt-PA undergoes hepatic clearance which may be reduced in hepatic dysfunction with potential increase serum levels and risk of ICH. Advanced hepatic dysfunction may be associated with coagulopathy with elevation in prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and thrombocytopenia. However, in acute hepatic dysfunction, either a prothrombotic state or coagulopathy can exist which is not fully identified by PT and INR values.
39
Therefore, a rapid bedside tool of thromboelastography may provide assessment of hemostatic characteristics in patients with hepatic dysfunction and sepsis
40
be measuring maximum clot firmness, maximum clot lysis, maximum elasticity, and clot strength reduction.

The relationship between low platelet counts, elevated PT or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and risk of hemorrhagic complications in ischemic stroke patients receiving intravenous rt-PA is unclear. Current guidelines state
34
that intravenous rt-PA may be considered on a case-by-case basis and is reasonable in patients who have a history of warfarin use and an INR <=1.7 and/or a PT < 15 s, or those with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis or systemic malignancy with normal INR and APTT.

Conclusion and practice implications

The relatively high prevalence of elevated concentration of inflammation and hypercoagulabilty markers such as leukocytosis, and C reactive protein and D dimers in patients with COVID-19 infection need to be recognized. While none of these laboratory abnormalities are a contraindication to intravenous rt-PA, previous studies conducted in patients with acute ischemic stroke but without COVID-19 infection demonstrated a higher rate of death or disability and post thrombolytic ICH.

Hepatic dysfunction (transaminases elevation) without coagulopathy (normal PT, INR, APTT, platelet count) can occur in patients with COVID-19 infection. Despite the concern of impaired rt-PA hepatic clearance, no data are available to suggest a greater risk or benefit with intravenous rt-PA.

Hepatic dysfunction manifesting with coagulopathy (elevated prothrombin time, INR, activated partial thromboplastin time, or reduced platelet count) can occur in patients with COVID-19 infection. The current guidelines specify certain eligibility thresholds based on PT, INR, APTT, or reduced platelet counts although there is ambiguity regarding thresholds associated with greater risk or benefit with intravenous rt-PA.

Additional tests for assessing coagulation profile such as thromboelastography and serum concentration of D-dimers have been useful in sepsis and hepatic dysfunction and may be considered as needed. For patients with COVID-19 disease and other organ involvement, a detailed assessment of coagulation profile to determine risk benefit ratio is preferable prior to intravenous rt-PA administration.

Section 9. Mechanical thrombectomy

Current guidelines
34
recommend mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in adult patients with ischemic stroke caused by the internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery (identified by CT angiogram) occlusion, have a NIHSS score >=6, do not have extensive ischemic changes on CT scan, and if they can be treated within 6 h of symptom onset.
34
Mechanical thrombectomy is recommended in selected acute stroke patients within 6-16 h of last known normal and is considered reasonable in selected acute stroke patients within 6-24 h of last known normal but requires CT perfusion or MRI to identify potentially salvageable tissue.
34
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be new challenges in triaging stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, who cannot be transferred rapidly to angiographic suite from ED or from outside the hospital due to added requirements. Inter-facility transfer, which occurs in 44%-72% of acute ischemic stroke patients
41
,
42
may require special equipment and personnel that are likely to delay the procedure. Due to expected challenges, intravenous rt-PA in an isolation ward, rather than percutaneous coronary intervention has been recommended for patients with acute myocardial infarction.
43
,
44

Conclusion and practice implications

New challenges in existing triage protocols for facilitating rapid transfers from ED to angiographic suite and between facilities should be anticipated because of new protocols to ensure early detection of COVID-19 infection and reduction in transmission.

Given the complexities associated with performing invasive procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, a stringent policy is required to select acute ischemic stroke patients for mechanical thrombectomy. Although decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis, the highest rates of favorable outcomes are expected in those who meet inclusion criteria used in clinical trials and when procedures can be initiated and performed rapidly.

In appropriate candidates, it may be reasonable to initiate mechanical thrombectomy assuming the patient has COVID-19 infection with appropriate precautions to avoid delays in mechanical thrombectomy.

Section 10. Intubation and mechanical ventilation

Current guidelines recommend the selection of general anesthesia or conscious sedation to be based on individual patient risk factors, technical aspects of the procedure, and other clinical characteristics.
34
Approximately 28-38% of the patients with acute ischemic stroke (prior to emergence of COVID-19 pandemic) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy received general anesthesia due to high stroke severity, poor respiratory status, altered level of consciousness, or inability to follow commands with variations noted among institutions.
45
Approximately 6-14% of acute ischemic stroke patients required unplanned intubation during mechanical thrombectomy
46
due to severe agitation, apnea after sedation bolus, and respiratory insufficiency. Patients with COVID-19 infection may be at higher risk for intubation because of respiratory failure with almost 20% having hypoxic respiratory failure.
9
Cardiac guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic
43
recommend a low threshold in considering intubation in a patient with borderline respiratory status to avoid emergent intubation and reduce transmission risk to staff in the catheterization laboratory by managing ventilation through a closed circuit.

Conclusion and practice implications

A low threshold for initiating intubation, mechanical ventilation, and general anesthesia may be required in patients with COVID-19 infection who are selected for mechanical thrombectomy to reduce exposure risk during procedure by maintaining ventilation through closed circuit and avoiding unplanned intubations.

A tracheobronchial specimen for confirmation of suspected COVID-19 infection may be obtained at the time of intubation.

Section 11. Timing of intubation and mechanical ventilation

Endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, placing patient in prone position, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation are all aerosol generating procedures that increase risk of transmission to healthcare professionals.
47
Therefore, intubation in a negative-pressure room in teams of two to four experienced members with enclosed, ventilated protective suits, with video-guided laryngoscopy is recommended
22
,
48
with minimum number of attempts to reduce duration of exposure to the patient. The cardiac guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic
43
recommended patients should be intubated prior to arrival to the catheterization laboratory to reduce exposure to personnel in angiographic suite.

Conclusion and practice implications

Several components of endotracheal intubation are aerosol-generating procedures that increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, intubation and mechanical ventilation should be performed in the most optimal settings, which may not possible in the angiographic suite. It may be best for intubation and mechanical ventilation to be completed prior to arrival at an angiographic suite.

Section 12. The risk of intubation and general anesthesia

A greater proportion of acute ischemic stroke patients receiving general anesthesia due to COVID-19 infection also requires recognition that mechanical thrombectomy had higher odds of death, disability, or respiratory complications (pneumonia and prolonged mechanical ventilation) when used in acute ischemic stroke patients in previous studies.
45
The increase in death or disability rates associated with general anesthesia were attributed to intraprocedural hypotension
49
and hypocapnia due to hyperventilation at the time of intubation.
50
Patients with COVID-19 infection may be at higher risk for hypotension, due to underlying volume depletion (reduced fluid intake, fever and tachypnea), sepsis, or multiple organ dysfunctions. Strict parameters for intubation/anesthesia protocol used in three randomized clinical trials reduced the risk of death or disability to values comparable to local anesthesia.
51
-
53
All three trials used short acting anesthetic agents and blood pressure goals were prespecified and any hypotension during the intubation process was treated with intravenous vasopressors

Table 3.
Parameters used in the SIESTA trial

to reduce minimize risk of death or disability in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Conclusion and practice implications

Strict parameters for systolic blood pressure or mean arterial pressure and end tidal CO
2
should be used to reduce the risk of death or disability in patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to mechanical thrombectomy, particularly in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections.

Section 13. Personnel in angiographic suite

Standard precautions prior to emergence of COVID-19 infection included the use of personal protective equipment that consisted of a cap, standard surgical/medical masks mask, eye protection (proper splash protection), sterile (non-porous) gown, and sterile gloves, for anyone involved in the insertion of catheters or for guidewire exchange,
54
shoe covers were optional. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines
22
recommend using standard masks, due to lack of evidence of superiority of particulate filtering facepiece respirator. This is in addition to standard, personal, protective equipment for healthcare providers who are performing non-aerosol-generating procedures on mechanically ventilated (closed circuit) patients with COVID-19 infection and are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy. Cardiac guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic
43
recommended particulate filtering facepiece respirator and eye protection for all catheterization laboratory personnel due to the risk of emergent intubation, suctioning, and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Conclusion and practice implications

All healthcare providers within the angiographic suite should wear surgical/medical masks, gloves, gown, and eye protection, such as a face shield or safety goggles at the minimum. The preferential use of particulate filtering facepiece respirator may depend upon availability and institutional policy. The limitations posed by additional personnel protective equipment in communication and technical aspects during procedure need to be considered.

Section 14. Surface contamination and transmission in the angiographic suite

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from contaminated environmental surfaces and equipment to healthcare providers and other patients is a serious concern in the angiographic suite. The SARS-CoV-2 can survive in aerosol up to 3 h, on copper up to 4 h, on cardboard up to 24 h, on stainless steel metal and plastic surface up to 72 h.
19
Mechanical thrombectomy procedures are performed in a radiographic-fluoroscopic room, usually equipped with biplane floor-mounted and ceiling-mounted C-arm angiography systems with two flat detectors. The patients are placed on a floor-mounted patient table with cantilevered carbon-fiber tabletop with a special, contoured foam mattress placed on the table. Use of non-porous sterile coverings on all areas in the procedure field is the currently acceptable procedure.
54
The area that requires such preparation may be increased in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. There are existing protocols for critical (introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other normally sterile areas of the body), semi critical (contact with mucous membranes), and non-critical (contact with intact skin), high touch (frequent touch by patients and health care workers) and low touch (infrequent touch) surfaces and spills. These protocols are likely to be modified requiring decontamination of work surfaces and equipment with designated hospital disinfectants (quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine releasing agents, and alcohols 60-80% concentration) effective against SARS-CoV-2 with recommended contact time. Saline or contrast that may have contact with patient's blood or secretion may need to discard using closed systems. Terminal cleaning requiring decontamination of patient area and surrounding zone and equipment between procedures may be required by specialized teams
43
to avoid transmission to the next patient.

Conclusion and practice implications

Angiographic suites must have a policy that identifies the principles of decontamination and disinfectants for various categories of items (critical items, semi-critical items, and noncritical items) and surfaces (high touch and low touch) in the event a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection undergoes mechanical thrombectomy.

A protocol for terminal cleaning is required to ensure that there is no transfer of COVID-19 infection to the next patient.

Institutional strategies must be developed to reduce longer than anticipated procedure times due to new precautionary measures for decontamination in angiographic suites.

Section 15. Ventilation and airflow in angiographic suite

Current guidelines recommend negative-pressure rooms with anterooms or industrial-grade, high efficiency particulate air filter units for patients with airborne viral diseases. The negative-pressure room ensures that air flows into the angiographic suite towards the patient by using a > -2.5 Pa (0.01'' water gauge) pressure differential and >=12 air changes per hour. The filtration efficiency of 99.97% for particles of 0.3 um diameter is recommended. Cardiac guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic
43
recommend negative pressure angiographic suite but acknowledge that most catheterization labs have either normal or positive ventilation systems.

Conclusion and practice implications

Although it is preferable to use negative pressure angiographic suites for mechanical thrombectomy, the lack of such angiographic suites in most institutions may make any recommendation impractical.

Section 16. Use of aspirin, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, and heparin

Currently, guidelines
34
recommend immediate oral administration of aspirin or a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel after minor ischemic stroke or TIA, or after 24 h in patients treated with intravenous rt-PA. The possibility as to whether anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents may be superior in stroke patients with COVID-19 infection requires consideration. In sepsis, lipopolysaccharide triggers a procoagulant state via the tissue factor-dependent pathway of coagulation, which is reduced by heparin and hirudin
55
but not aspirin.
55
In patients with infections, platelet hyperactivity via ADP signaling is reported.
56
It remains unclear whether there is a superiority of P2Y12 receptor ADP antagonist such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor in such settings.
56

Conclusion and practice implications

Consistent with existing data, antiplatelet medication may be avoided if possible for the first 24 h after receiving intravenous rt-PA and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection until the risk can be better defined.

Single or dual antiplatelet medication may be considered in acute ischemic stroke who do not receive intravenous rt-PA and/or mechanical thrombectomy in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. No clinical data suggest superiority of one antiplatelet agent over another in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in these patients. It may be valuable to identify underlying coagulation profile by laboratory testing as mentioned in previous section.

Section 17. Additional considerations

Comprehensive and designated stroke centers have a high volume of stroke patients with some receiving intravenous rt-PA, mechanical thrombectomy, or requiring longer hospital stay. A high number of other procedures such as endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, carotid stenosis, and arteriovenous malformations are performed as well. Designated stroke centers are more likely to be large volume, level I or II trauma centers, and teaching hospitals. Therefore, such centers may become the designated center for the management of stroke patients with COVID-19 infection. A dedicated angiographic suite equipped with personal protective equipment, terminal cleaning supplies, anesthesia machines, and ventilators may have to be installed. Several organizations are anticipating the challenge
43
,
57
and have recommended downsizing case volumes (e.g. deferral of elective cases) and or shift-based allocation of staff/physicians to operate the angiographic suite with lower staffing. Staff shortage could be anticipated based on the possibility that some members in the stroke team may be infected or exposed or quarantined with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposure is also reduced by avoiding use of overlapping skills such as two neuro interventionalists in the same unit simultaneously.
43

Conclusion and practice implications

Comprehensive and designated stroke centers must anticipate new challenges because of mismatch between demand and resources. It can be expected that there will be a deviation of resources from service lines responsible for management of stroke patients to those responsible for management of COVID-19 infection because of the concurrent engagement of two separate specialties in comprehensive and designated stroke centers.

A high volume of elective neuro-endovascular procedures may need to be deferred to meet new demands placed on comprehensive or designated stroke centers. Institutional policies and triage pathways can ensure standardized resource allocation.

Section 18. Need for additional data

A range of issues regarding acute ischemic stroke management can be confounded by stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and deserve further analysis (

).

A corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 986,776 persons as of April 2nd, 2020 over a period of 4 months. There is a possibility that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection increases the risk of stroke similar to other respiratory tract infections [

]. Here we wish to provide insight from the panel with direct relevence to emergency medicine health care providers.

Healthcare professionals involved in evaluation and management of acute stroke patients are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infected patients or those who are asymptomatic carriers or in the prodromal period, or in whom neurological deficits is the first manifestation. The magnitude of risk of COVID-19 infection transmission during acute stroke patient management is not known. The time frame required to confirm the infection based on upper respiratory specimen using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test and at times need for repeat testing does not allow the information to be available to stroke team members at time of decision making. Members of stroke team must use basic principles targeting prevention of disease transmission including maintaining a 1-meter distance from patient (unless absolutely necessary) and use a combination of use of surgical mask gloves, gowns, goggles or face shield and handwashing. Whether a particulate filtering facepiece respirator such as N95 (United States), FFP2 (Europe), KN95 (China), P2 (Australia/New Zealand), K94 (Korea KMOEL), or DS (Japan) is necessary is not clear as stroke evaluation does not involve aerosol generating procedures [

]. However, such use may be regulated by country and institution specific standards and also depend upon availability and regional COVID-19 infection prevalence. The stroke team evaluating the patient should comprise the minimum number of medical professionals and preferably exclude those professionals who are at high-risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Telestroke is the most effective strategy to avoid transmission by not being in the same room or space where the stroke patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection is located. All aspects of acute stroke management can be performed via Telestroke [

]. Institutions may explore with the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board whether commercially available low-cost smartphone application systems can substitute in locations where Telestroke networks are not available.

The high rate of mortality in COVID-19 infected patients who have multiple organ dysfunction/failure needs to be recognized and is unlikely to be influenced from acute treatment of stroke [

]. An assessment of magnitude of organ dysfunction using validated scales such as sequential organ failure assessment score maybe helpful in delineating the overall care paradigm in acute stroke patients appropriate to the expected prognosis independent of stroke related factors. Clinical evaluation and computed tomographic (CT) scan are usually supplemented by contrast-based studies such as CT angiography and CT perfusion to identify patients who are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy. Negative carrier isolator bag for patients during imaging may ensure the safety of health care providers and concurrent pulmonary imaging can identify COVID-19 pulmonary infection (
Fig. 1
). COVID-19 infection and stroke both have a relatively high risk of renal insufficiency and perhaps even higher when both occur together. Contrast exposure can precipitate acute kidney injury particularly in those with existing renal impairment which may subsequently increase the risk of death. Therefore, studies using contrast may be considered after evaluation of renal function and whether mechanical thrombectomy is even a consideration. There is limited data regarding use of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis in settings of infection [

]. Current guidelines do not support use of IV thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage [

Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.

]. Elevated concentration of inflammation and hypercoagulability markers such as C reactive protein and D dimers in patients with COVID-19 infection suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. While none of these laboratory abnormalities are a contraindication to IV thrombolysis, previous studies conducted in non COVID-19 infected acute ischemic stroke patients demonstrated a higher rate of death or disability and post thrombolytic intracerebral hemorrhages in such patients [

]. Additional tests for assessing coagulation profile such as thromboelastography and serum concentration of D dimers have been useful in sepsis and hepatic dysfunction and may be considered as needed. For patients with COVID-19 infection and other organ involvement, a detailed assessment of coagulation profile is preferable prior to decision regarding IV thrombolysis to determine risk benefit ratio.

Current guidelines recommend mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke in patients >=18 years who have a causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery and can be treated within 6 h of last known normal [

]. In addition to patient characteristics, the time interval between symptom onset and initiation of treatment and procedure time are important determinants of benefit of procedure. In the current era of COVID-19 pandemic there will be a new challenge in triage of these patients as suspected or known COVID-19 patients cannot be transferred rapidly to angiographic suites from emergency departments or from outside hospitals due to screening and exposure reduction requirements. Interfacility transfer may require special equipment and personnel which is likely to delay the procedure. Obtaining informed consents in light of ""no visitor hospital policies"" may require waiver of consent or remote electronic informed consent for such procedures. Due to expected challenges, IV thrombolysis in an isolation ward has been recommended preferentially in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and general anesthesia may be required in a relatively large proportion (if not all) of patients due to underlying COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency and stroke related neurological deficits, and to reduce aerosol exposure and avoid unplanned intubation within angiographic unit. Tracheobroncholar sample may be acquired at time of intubation to confirm patient's diagnosis and infectious potential. Due to the additional precautions required in endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, and manual ventilation before intubation in COVID-19 infected patients, the intubation is best performed prior to arrival to the angiographic suite by an experienced team using appropriate protective gear and special equipment. Strict parameters for systolic blood pressure or mean arterial pressure and end tidal carbon dioxide need to be used to reduce the risk of death or disability in patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to mechanical thrombectomy in previous reports [

]. All health care professionals within the angiographic suite should wear surgical/medical masks, gloves, gown, and eye protection, such as a face shield or safety goggles at the minimum and a particulate filtering facepiece respirator if required. There may be limitations in interpersonal communication and technical comments imposed by personal protective equipment.

Mechanical thrombectomy procedures are performed in radiographic-fluoroscopic room, usually equipped with biplane floor-mounted and ceiling-mounted C-arm angiography system with two flat detectors mounted on a motorized rotating turntable. The patients are placed on a floor-mounted cantilevered carbon-fiber tabletop covered with special contoured foam mattress. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from contaminated environmental surfaces and non-critical equipment to health care workers and other patients is a serious concern because SARS-CoV-2 can survive in aerosol up to 3 h, on copper up to 4 h, on cardboard up to 24 h, on stainless steel metal and plastic surface up to 72 h [

]. Use of non-porous sterile coverings on all areas in procedure field is the currently acceptable procedure. A policy is required that identifies the principles of decontamination and disinfectants (different concentration and exposure time required for elimination of SARS-CoV-2 virus) for various categories of contaminated items (critical items from blood stream, semi-critical items from mucous membranes, and noncritical items from intact skin) and surfaces (high touch and low touch) when a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection undergoes mechanical thrombectomy. A protocol for terminal clean must be developed if not already available to reduce and eliminate microbial contamination to avoid transfer of microorganisms to the next patient. Strategies to reduce anticipated longer procedure time due to new precautionary measures in acute ischemic patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy need to be considered at institutional level. A negative-pressure rooms with anterooms for patients with airborne viral diseases is recommended with or without portable, industrial-grade high efficiency particulate air filter units. Although it is preferable to use negative pressure angiographic suites for mechanical thrombectomy, such angiographic suites do not exist in most institutions.

Comprehensive and designated stroke centers must anticipate new challenges because of mismatch between demand and resources. A deviation of resources towards service lines responsible for management of patients with COVID-19 infection may occur because of concurrent existence of other specialties in comprehensive and designated stroke centers. The high volume of elective neuroendovascular procedures incomprehensive stroke centers may require cancellation and deferral to preserve resources for acute stroke management. Transitional Care Units may be required to reduce the risk of transmission in post procedure period.

Prospective registries may help understand whether there are differences in stroke risk, manifestations, response to treatment strategies, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors are more likely to experience adverse outcomes associated with the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, consistent reports of cardiac injury and de novo cardiac complications, including possible myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure in patients without prior cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors, are emerging, possibly due to an accentuated host immune response and cytokine release syndrome. As the spread of the virus increases exponentially, many patients will require medical care either for COVID-19 related or traditional cardiovascular issues. While the COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the attention of the healthcare system, there is an unmet need for a standardized approach to deal with COVID-19 associated and other traditional cardiovascular issues during this period.

Abstract

Even though the early reports from China provided advance warning of what was to come, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world with devastating consequences. Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease. Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale. Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm. The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful."

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease currently affecting millions of people worldwide. Its neurological implications are poorly understood, and further study is urgently required. A hypercoagulable state has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19, but nothing is known about coagulopathy in patients with milder disease. We describe cases of patients in New York City presenting with stroke secondary to large vessel thrombosis without occlusion, incidentally found to have COVID-19 with only mild respiratory symptoms. This is in contrast to the venous thrombosis and microangiopathy that has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19. Our cases suggest that even in the absence of severe disease, patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of thrombus formation leading to stroke, perhaps due to viral involvement of the endothelium. Further systematic study is needed, since this may have implications for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with COVID-19.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become the deadliest pandemic in modern history, reaching nearly every country worldwide and overwhelming healthcare institutions. As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.

There is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19, but MSC therapies have shown first promise in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, inflammation, and sepsis, which are among the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments. We here propose three steps to mitigate the risk for these vulnerable patients: (1) updated clinical guidelines for cell and tissue transplantation, (2) updated minimal criteria for characterization of cellular therapeutics, and (3) updated cell therapy routines reflecting specific patient needs.

The Promise Of Msc Therapies As Treatment For Covid-19

Coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought many intensive care units (ICUs) in hotspots of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection throughout China, Europe, and America to the brink of collapse in the past months, and the virus continues to spread rapidly throughout the globe (
Figure 1A
, left panel) (
1
-
3
). To date, no approved effective therapy is available that can halt the progression of COVID-19 and can address the critical cases with high fatality, driving public fear in the ""Corona Crisis."" Thus, any treatment that could reduce case fatality by alleviating severe COVID-19 and speed up the recovery of critically ill patients is in great demand, with advanced mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapeutics holding promise to fulfill this need (
4
-
8
).

In the majority of patients, SARS-CoV-2 infections range from being asymptomatic to seasonal flu-like symptoms, while ~14% of cases presented with severe outcomes and ~6 and ~3% with critical and fatal outcomes, respectively (
9
,
10
). The severe cases require ICU care due to lung and multi-organ failure, being associated with tissue damage and a virus-induced cytokine storm with a distinct pattern (
11
-
14
). Depending on patient sex/age, comorbidities, and available ICU capacity, mortality in the critical ventilated patient population with respiratory failure has been reported to be as high as 50%--with sepsis or septic shock a leading cause of death (
14
-
16
). Another major concern is the abnormal coagulation profile seen in many critically ill ICU patients in potential need of MSC therapy (
15
-
26
).

Although first case reports on MSCs for COVID-19 gathered during the early outbreak phase in China provide valuable hints that the treatment may be somewhat safe and efficacious, experts agree that proper clinical investigations are now essential (
27
-
29
,
47
). Conclusions from these first studies are limited due to the small number of included patients (typically no more than 10) and the lack of adequate control groups (
48
-
50
). Proper clinical trial design and adherence to quality measures, such as documentation of included patients, inclusion/exclusion criteria, stratification of treatment arms, primary and secondary readouts, and timing and dosing regimens of treatments and comedication, are urgently needed (
47
,
51
).

Although early results might appear promising, one should be reminded of both the previous failures of advanced clinical studies with MSCs and the low level of approved MSC products (
5
,
8
,
52
-
54
). Multiple problems were identified, such as failures in up-scaling the product manufacturing to large-scale supply and a loss in translation to effective clinical application (e.g., degree of cell expansion from limited starting material, cell viability issues post-thawing, and suboptimal route of delivery) (
7
,
35
,
55
-
57
), which may explain study failures (
5
,
8
). If some of the advanced phase II/III clinical studies produce more solid evidence supporting product approval in the months to come (as discussed below), another key issue for sustainable marketing will be the technological readiness level of the products and their manufacturers (
52
,
53
). The dynamics of the pandemic virus spread and the rising number of global deaths make it clear that major manufacturing and sound logistic capacity are needed to supply sufficient doses of high-quality cell product in a reproducible and timely manner.

Hypercoaguability In Covid-19 Patients With Poor Prognosis Mandates Great Caution With Iv Delivery Of Msc Therapeutics

The most frequently anticipated form of cell product delivery in ARDS and COVID-19 is the intravenous (IV) infusion of MSCs with the primary aim of targeting the lungs (
6
-
8
). It is not yet clear if this is a safe and effective route of cell delivery in COVID-19, considering that MSC products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142) (
58
), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile (
Figure 1B
) (
6
-
8
,
59
-
61
). Numerous clinical reports indicate (
15
-
26
) that many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis are in a systemic procoagulant state at high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, one of the leading causes of death in these patients. This would make IV applications of MSCs a contraindication in COVID-19 due to the potential harm to these patients (
6
-
8
,
59
-
61
).

A first study reported in February 2020 by Dr. Ning Tang et al. from Wuhan, China (
17
,
18
) found that 71.4% of non-survivors compared to 0.6% of survivors in a cohort of 183 consecutively included COVID-19 patients met the ISTH diagnostic criteria for overt DIC (>=5 points) (
17
,
62
). This included significantly elevated levels of D-dimer (>1 mg/mL) (
22
) and fibrin-degradation product and longer prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The median time from admission to DIC was 4 days, and it was evident that abnormal coagulation parameters (e.g., elevated D-dimer) may act as potential predictors of a poor prognosis.

In a larger cohort reported in April 2020 by Dr. Tao Wang on behalf of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (
19
), ~40% of COVID-19 patients (407 of the 1,026 included cases) were at high risk of thromboembolism. It was estimated that 11% of these high-risk patients develop venous thromboembolism without appropriate prophylaxis (
63
), but only a few (7%) of the patients were given blood thinners (mainly heparin) during hospitalization (
19
). In total, 11% (44 of 407) of patients at high risk for thromboembolism were also at high risk for bleeding, which may explain the hesitation to use anticoagulants. It was recommended that for these patients, the dose and duration of anticoagulants should be carefully adjusted.

The risk for thromboembolism is further substantiated by a case study of three COVID-19 patients managed by a team from Peking Union Medical College Hospital at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China (
20
). The first patient presented with ischemia in the lower limbs and in two digits of the left hand. Computed tomographic imaging of the brain showed bilateral cerebral infarcts in multiple vascular territories. Laboratory analysis documented leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated PT and APTT, and elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer. Serological testing revealed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can arise transiently in patients with critical illnesses and infections. Two other patients with similar findings were seen in the ICU for COVID-19 patients at Tongji Hospital.

These early reports from China have been confirmed by a Dutch multi-center study incorporating 184 ICU patients who received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis at hospital admission (
21
,
22
). Klok et al. still documented thrombotic complications in 31% of patients and emphasized the strict need for thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (
21
). Others also suggested targeting both the prothrombotic state and complement-activation-induced microvascular injury in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection (
23
,
64
). Several newly initiated studies are now investigating the optimal dosing of thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of clot formation, and, alternatively, also treatments that can dissolve already existing clots with agents such as tissue plasminogen activator and antithrombotic therapies typically reserved for the treatment of strokes and heart attacks (
25
,
26
,
65
).

In conclusion, preliminary data on COVID-19 indicate a substantial risk that infusions of TF/CD142-expressing MSC products could aggravate the pro-thrombotic state of COVID-19 (and other categories of patients in a hypercoagulable state) and increase the risk of associated complications such as DIC, thrombosis, and thrombotic multi-organ failure (
7
,
19
,
20
,
59
). We here wish to raise awareness to this safety issue to raise awareness to this safety issue, provide scientific context, and propose three steps for improved product characterization, optimized product delivery, and comprehensive integration of innate hemocompatibility testing for IV-applied cellular therapies into clinical practice, as outlined in the following paragraphs.

It is apparent that there is an urgent clinical need for new guidelines on hemocompatibility testing for IV-delivered cellular therapeutics for two major reasons (
Figure 2
) (
7
,
8
,
59
-
61
) (1) the varying risk profiles of patients considered for treatment with IV-MSC therapeutics, and (2) the difficult-to-predict risk profiles of the different clinically available MSC products. Differences may also exist in the quality of MSC therapeutics and their mode of delivery when comparing products from major well-established manufacturing centers that have many years of experience with poorly documented unregulated small-scale operations that produce products with unknown properties (e.g., as a result of batch-to-batch inconsistency) due to poor standard operating procedures and a distinct lack of clinical routines.

First of all, the risk profile of patients differs greatly due to the large diversity of indications and concomitant hemostatic profiles, particularly in patients with hypercoagulability (
66
). The prior example of COVID-19 made it clear that particularly critically ill patients with a poor prognosis in potential need of MSC-therapy are in a highly activated hypercoagulable state and thus at risk of dying from DIC, embolism, and thrombotic multi-organ-failure. The same applies to other pre-activated patient indications, such as severe trauma and sepsis, and in patients with considerable comorbidities, such as advanced diabetes and renal failure. Indeed, several reports already documented cases of DIC and thromboembolism occurring after the infusion of TF/CD142-expressing MSC products, particularly in preactivated patients (
7
).

The second issue is the varying risk profiles of different MSC products, e.g., depending on the degree of TF/CD142 expression and the anticipated route of clinical delivery. MSC treatments greatly diversified prior to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (
7
), and available treatments differ greatly in their hemocompatibility (
Figure 2A
, left panel). The initial safety profiles for MSC infusions were established with bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs, which have low TF/CD142 expression, but nowadays, we have approximately equal shares of three major sources: BM-, adipose tissue (AT)-, and perinatal tissue (PT)-derived MSC products. All three differ greatly in their expression of highly procoagulant TF/CD142, thus affecting their safety and efficacy profiles and the preferential route of clinical delivery (
Figure 2A
, center) (
7
).

Appreciating the complexities surrounding both patients and the background of MSC-products highlights the danger of utilizing poorly characterized experimental products with unchecked/high TF/CD142 expression. This could prove particularly problematic for those patients that suffer from a dysregulation of the hemostatic system (
66
). George et al. reported that blood clotting in trauma patients in a state of hypercoagulability was accelerated by commonly used IV-infused cellular therapeutics in relation to the degree of TF/CD142 expression in the product (
8
,
60
,
61
,
66
). To illustrate that this is not just a hypothetical risk, peripheral microthrombosis, embolism, and even potential cases of death have already been documented in patients that received infusions of highly TF/CD142-expressing MSCs (
67
-
69
), and it is expected that similar cases may arise as a result of MSC infusion in COVID-19.

Alternative routes of cell administration such as intramuscular (IM) injection are increasingly explored as alternatives to IV injection (
Figure 2A
, right) because of longer
in vivo
survival of the cells, improved functionality, and a lack of hemocompatibility issues (
8
,
57
,
70
-
73
). Galipeau et al. found that potency is dependent on the route of cell delivery, cell viability, and immune match (
57
) and that the mode of delivery impacts strongly on MSCs' therapeutic activity (
73
). IM delivery potentiates the dwell time of MSCs due to the favorable
in vivo
milieu (
8
,
70
,
72
). The highly vascularized muscle tissue serves as a physiological environment able to supply the therapeutic cells with oxygen and nutrients and to safeguard their prolonged survival while also supporting their prolonged secretion of beneficial paracrine mediators.

The integrated understanding of product properties, patient background, and optimal cell delivery is crucial for the safe and effective use of MSCs and other products (
6
-
8
). The preferential use of well-characterized products from robust manufacturing sources with optimized modes of delivery [e.g., careful consideration of intravascular (IV) vs. intramuscular (IM) vs. intratracheal (IT) modes of delivery depending on product properties] and appropriate adjunct patient treatment protocols (e.g., suitable anticoagulation and other comedication) may greatly mitigate any risk for patients and allow MSCs to live up to their full potential. These high-quality cell products may become valuable therapeutics (
6
), in contrast to poorly characterized cell products with high batch-to-batch heterogeneity and unsuitable protocols for clinical application, which may pose a risk to patients.

Considering risk-benefit approximation, the priority in early-phase trials is clearly safety, with a reasonable but careful dose-escalation. Importantly, higher dosing is usually assumed to be beneficial in clinical trials due to a perceived increase in active agent/treatment potency. However, the detrimental worst-case combination of infusing highly TF/CD142-expressing MSCs at high doses into hypercoagulable patients should clearly be avoided, being a potential contraindication in COVID19 and thus clearly a dose-limiting factor. In contrast, MSCs with low or absent TF/CD142 may be suitable for IV delivery in hypercoagulable patients with appropriate treatment protocols (e.g., suitable anticoagulation), making the MSC tissue source and the intrinsic cellular potency one of the decisive factors (
7
). Advanced trials need to carefully weigh the risk to patients resulting from adverse events or treatment failure (e.g., lack of efficacy) vs. short- and long-term benefits for the patient (
35
), requiring sufficient product potency/efficacy and appropriate measures thereof in patients (
Table S1
).

A collection of higher study endpoints extracted from
Table S1
includes parameters such as: (1)
respiratory function
(e.g., oxygen index 3 days after MSC infusion or measured by chest computerized tomography at days 2 and 14), and (2)
mortality/survival
[e.g., at days 14 and 28 (death by any cause) and ICU/hospital stay at day 28 (total duration), ideally with long-term 1-year follow-up], (3)
lung mechanics and ventilator weaning
(e.g., arterial oxygen saturation, tidal volume, minute ventilation, ratio PaO
2
/FiO
2
, failure of ventilator weaning, weaning time, and ventilation time), (4)
hemodynamic parameters
(e.g., systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure), (5)
inflammation and infection
(may differ for viral and bacterial, e.g., plasma cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or only IL-6/8 with early monitoring 6 h post-MSC and at days 1, 2, and 3, then also lactate, DIC score, SOFA score, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin), and (6)
lowering lung fibrosis
(important for recovering lung-capacity in ""cured"" patients and hence enabling future ability to return to job and reducing health care costs for survivors). We here wish to give a short outline of the preliminary results of some representative clinical studies from major well-established and regulated manufacturers, as recently compiled by
CellTrials.Org
(
29
).

In the newly registered advanced COVID-19 trials of Athersys (MAPC-/BM-MSC-based MultiStem
(r)
product) and Mesoblasts (BM-MSC-based), the cell product is delivered IV. These cell products have low TF/CD142 expression (
6
-
8
,
74
), which may be tolerated with appropriate adjunct infusion protocols and well-defined patient inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., excluding pre-history of patient coagulopathy). Both Athersys and Mesoblast reported preliminary safety and efficacy in preceding studies and have now advanced to phase II/III studies with prior approval by the corresponding regulatory authorities such as the FDA (
29
).

AT-derived MSCs are among the highly TF/CD142-expressing cell products, and careful dose-escalation by TiGenix/Takeda in their SPECELL study (AT-MSCs Cx611 product) has shown a significant increase in the coagulation activation markers thrombin-antithrombin-complex (TAT) and D-dimer for infusion of 4 million cells/kg vs. controls in healthy volunteers with normal coagulation parameters (
75
). Accordingly, the dose-limiting toxicity should be lower in hypercoagulable COVID-19 patients, potentially limiting the cell dose to <4 million cells/kg.

The TF/CD142 load of a given MSC product may be of less or no importance for IM and IT delivery due to the delivery of the cells into the extravascular space (avoiding blood contact), therefore allowing for higher cell doses than IV infusions without dose-limiting toxicity. Pluristem typically employs IM injection of high cell doses of placenta-derived MSC-like cells (typically up to 300 million cells/patient are used, but also higher doses can easily be applied without apparent safety concerns), and preliminary data from eight patients treated in Israel and the United States have shown good safety and efficacy, thus also proceeding to phase II/III studies.

In conclusion, while the primary risk outlined earlier in this perspective is clear perspective is clear, the potential benefit is more difficult to assess/define in ARDS and COVID-19 due to the current lack of efficacy data and the general need for a more clearly defined MoA (
33
). Considering potency and efficacy, it has been speculated that close proximity of the cells to the major sites of pathological damage (such as the lungs) may be of advantage, though this is yet to be proven due to the complex MoA. A clear advantage of IM or IT over IV delivery lies in the higher effective cell dose that can be applied to patients, thus increasing the amount of active agent and along potentially also the treatment potency and efficacy. Either way, decision-making is reliant on quantifying the TF/CD142 expression of MSCs and testing their hemocompatibility before clinical use.

More than 60 years ago, a great collaborative effort by Donall Thomas and his contemporary colleagues laid the foundation for modern transplant medicine through understanding the adaptive immune mechanisms underlying transplant incompatibility between humans (
76
). Once the mechanisms of recipient-donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility and matching were understood, transplantation of cell/tissue/organ grafts became feasible. Nowadays, well over 100,000 (allo)-transplantation procedures are performed annually worldwide, and they are regulated by, amongst others, the World Health Organization (WHO) and their Guiding Principles on Cell, Tissue, and Organ Transplantation (
77
). Considerations regarding adaptive immune compatibility testing in MSC characterization for clinical use were, as such, integrated into clinical practice at an early stage (
Figure 2B
, left) (
78
).

MSCs are one of the most widely used IV cell therapies of non-hematopoietic origin, and according to the ISCT minimal criteria (
85
), they are characterized by three major features: (1) plastic-adherent fibroblast-like morphology, (2) differentiation into multiple ""mesenchymal"" tissue lineages, and (3) presence or absence of specific cell surface markers. Recent efforts demonstrate that the minimal criteria can be adjusted according to specific clinical needs, such as allowing for the integration of MSC immune functional assays as a potency release criterion for advanced-phase clinical trials (
86
). We thus propose to update the panel of cell surface markers used to better characterize IV MSC therapies through the inclusion of a minimal set of markers indicative of hemocompatibility, and this would mainly encompass the expression of the highly procoagulant TF/CD142 (
Figure 2B
, right). In addition, standardized
in vitro
and
in vivo
hemocompatibility testing should be conducted for all new IV-applied MSC(-like) products and other cellular therapeutics prior to application in clinical trials. Cellular therapeutics differ greatly in TF/CD142 expression (
7
,
8
,
59
-
61
), but their hemocompatibility is not yet tested even when applied to patients via IV delivery (
85
). Thus, the risk of (lethal) thrombotic complications is most apparent if clinicians are not fully aware of this problem, and it is imperative that they are aware of said risks to enable the use of appropriate countermeasures (e.g. anticoagulation, if appropriate in a given patient indication) or the choice of more appropriate treatment options and application routes (e.g., IM instead IV injection) (
7
). We propose three critical steps to guarantee safe and effective cellular therapeutics in the future.

Recommendations

1. Updated Clinical Guidelines for Cell and Tissue Transplantation: Integration of essential considerations on hemocompatibility testing into the current clinical guidelines for cell and tissue transplantation in addition to well-established recommendations considering all aspects of allo-immunogenicity and other testing and in line with standards for hemocompatibility testing of medical devices in contact with blood (e.g., WHO recommendations on human cell and tissue transplantation and ISO10993-1/4 guidelines for medical devices) (
77
,
82
,
87
).

2. Updated Minimal Criteria for Characterization of Cellular Therapeutics: According to the intended mode of therapeutic cell delivery, hemocompatibility testing should be mandatory for all cellular therapeutics applied via intravascular delivery, particularly for non-hematopoietic cells not typically found in contact with blood (e.g., incorporation of TF/CD142 expression monitoring for therapeutic MSCs into the WHO recommendations and/or the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) minimal criteria) (
7
,
8
,
77
,
82
,
88
).

3. Updated Cell Therapy Routines Reflecting the Specific Patient Needs: The clinical cell product properties and mode of cell-delivery should anticipate the specific patient needs under consideration of the target indication to be treated (e.g., anticipation of anticoagulation protocols/bleeding risk and IM application as an alternative to IV infusion, shown to result in longer cell survival
in vivo
, associated with prolonged secretory activities, and a lack of coagulation issues, which may be important in the treatment of COVID-19) (
7
,
8
,
60
,
73
).

Conclusion

MSC products are rapidly emerging as promising treatment candidates for COVID-19 in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They are being currently extensively explored both by leading manufactures and in many small investigator-initiated trials. Although cellular therapeutics are already widely employed in both preclinical and clinical settings, they can differ greatly in their hemocompatibility aspects, and they have been only poorly characterized in this regard so far. In order to minimize the evident risk of (lethal) adverse thrombotic reactions upon infusion of high doses of poorly characterized unregulated cell products, we have here proposed three decisive steps for integrating innate immune hemocompatibility testing into the standard characterization and clinical routines or IV applied cell therapies, and we also encourage the considerations of alternative non-intravascular application regimes, which may prove to be safer and more efficient alternatives in the long-run.

To the Editor:

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state, and complicating venous thrombotic events are common.
1-3
Abnormalities in coagulation screening measures, including a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), have been reported in patients with Covid-19.
4
This finding could be seen as a reason to avoid the use of anticoagulation at both therapeutic and prophylactic doses.

A prolonged aPTT may indicate a clotting-factor deficiency or the presence of an inhibitor of coagulation that is either specific (e.g., antibody to factor VIII) or nonspecific (e.g., lupus anticoagulant). Lupus anticoagulant can affect in vitro tests of blood coagulation but typically is not associated with bleeding. As part of the antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant is associated with a thrombotic risk. We investigated the cause of prolonged aPTT in patients with Covid-19.

Blood specimens obtained from 216 patients who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were received for coagulation screening, and 44 (20%) were found to have a prolonged aPTT. The specimens from 9 patients were excluded, and those from 35 patients were investigated further. (Details of the methods are provided in the
Supplementary Appendix
, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics and Laboratory Findings in 35 Patients with Covid-19 and a Prolonged aPTT.

A summary of the results is provided in
Table 1
. The median age was 57 years, and 24 patients were male. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 1 patient, and clinically suspected thrombosis was present in 1 patient. No clinically significant bleeding or arterial thromboses were reported.

No patients were found to have deficiencies in factor VIII or factor IX. In 5 patients, marginal reductions in factor XI were found that were unlikely to be of clinical significance. The factor XII level was 50 IU per deciliter or lower in 16 patients. Lupus anticoagulant assays were performed in 34 patients, and 31 (91%) were positive. The presence of lupus anticoagulant was indicated by two assays (dilute Russell's viper-venom time [DRVVT] and lupus anticoagulant-sensitive aPTT) in 18 of 34 patients (53%), by DRVVT alone in 7 (21%), and by lupus anticoagulant-sensitive aPTT alone in 6 (18%). All lupus anticoagulant-positive specimens had a prolonged aPTT with a 50:50 mix (i.e., in a sample made up of 50% patient plasma and 50% normal plasma).

In a historical control cohort of 540 specimens received for lupus anticoagulant testing, 43 (8%) had an aPTT of 30 seconds or longer, and 11 of the 43 (26%) were positive for lupus anticoagulant. The percentage of specimens that were positive for lupus anticoagulant was significantly higher among the patients with Covid-19 than in the control cohort (P<0.001) (see the
Supplementary Appendix
).

In our study, most patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to the hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant (91%) and often had an associated factor XII deficiency. It is important to note that neither observation is associated with a bleeding tendency; factor XII is not required for hemostasis, and the presence of lupus anticoagulant, if persistent, can be associated with a thrombotic tendency within the antiphospholipid syndrome. Further study is required to determine the role, if any, of lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 thrombosis.

Although we detected heparin in 28 of the 35 specimens, the DRVVT assay contains heparinase, which neutralizes any heparin effect that might lead to false positive detection of lupus anticoagulant. An association between lupus anticoagulants and acquired factor XII deficiency secondary to factor XII antibodies has been described previously. It is notable that the aPTT prolongation in the patients in our study was present despite substantial elevations in factor VIII, which shortens the aPTT.

We suggest that a prolonged aPTT should not be a barrier to the use of anticoagulation therapies in the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis in patients with Covid-19. In our opinion, clinicians should not withhold use of anticoagulants for thrombosis while awaiting further investigation of a prolonged aPTT, nor should they withhold thrombolytic therapy in the face of a high-risk pulmonary embolism on the basis of a prolonged aPTT alone."

ABSTRACT

The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern. The outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020.
1
The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress. Some patients may also show neurologic signs and symptoms ranging from headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion to anosmia, ageusia, encephalitis, and stroke. Coronaviruses are known pathogens with neuroinvasive potential. There is increasing evidence that coronavirus infections are not always confined to the respiratory tract. Central nervous system involvement can occur in susceptible individuals and may contribute overall morbidity and mortality in the acute setting. Additionally, post-infectious, immune-mediated complications in the convalescent period are possible. Awareness and recognition of neurologic manifestations is essential to guide therapeutic decision-making as the current outbreak continues to unfold.

Abstract:
Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation
with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from
the providers notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to
advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg
patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a
two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation
and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma
fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of
patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these
measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with
declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower
and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented
curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events
after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet
reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal
trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19
associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes
longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural
network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study
demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each
patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing
better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has now reached a pandemic state, affecting more than a million patients worldwide. Predictors of disease outcomes in these patients need to be urgently assessed to decrease morbidity and societal burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral infections. In this pooled analysis of 9 published studies (
n
= 1532 COVID-19 patients), we evaluated the association between elevated LDH levels measured at earliest time point in hospitalization and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Elevated LDH levels were associated with a ~6-fold increase in odds of developing severe disease and a ~16-fold increase in odds of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

We still believe that the use of simple and easily available laboratory markers both at admission and while in the hospital is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients. Since the writing of this guidance and the letter from the experts being sent to us, there have been several reports of very high incidence of both arterial and venous thromboembolism (TE) in patients with COVID-19.
1
-
3
In one report published in the
Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis
, the incidence of venous TE was 25%, some of whom died from this complication.
2
Laboratory markers including D-dimer were relevant in these patients. The authors used D-dimer cutoff of 1.5 ug/mL for predicting venous TE and demonstrated sensitivity of 85.0% and specificity of 88.5% and negative predictive value of 94.7%.
2
They also suggested D-dimers may be used to monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulants, although this practice is not universally accepted. A recent case report also noted the ""decrease"" in D-dimers in a patient escalated to treatment dose anticoagulation (D-dimers decreased from 6.26 to 1.94 mg/L) reflecting in clinical improvement.
4
In relation to other haemostatic tests, Klok et al studied 184 patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit and identified age and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 seconds or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 seconds as independent predictors of thrombotic complications.
3
Fibrinogen is another marker of hypercoagulability. Extremely high fibrinogen levels are noted in the COVID-19 patients.
5
But we do understand measuring plasma fibrinogen is not routine in many laboratories and may not be ""necessary"" in all cases if there is overburden on the biomedical scientists' workload. On the other hand, monitoring of coagulation status by laboratory tests is useful especially when the manpower and access to computed tomography are limited.

In addition to measuring D-dimers and prothrombin time, platelet count measurements may also have clinical relevance in this scenario. COVID-19 literature is not replete with thrombocytopenia as a clinical feature but thrombocytosis has been reported.
5
Ranucci and colleagues have tried adding antiplatelet agent in critically ill COVID-19 patients with high platelet counts along with escalating the dose of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and noted some clinical benefits.
6
Platelet activation is likely to be contributing to the hypercoagulability but the extent to which it does and which signalling pathways are involved are certainly interesting areas of research.

Certainly, we admit the risk of anticoagulant therapy using heparins. If the platelet count does drop by 30% to 50% since the start of low molecular weight heparin or other types of heparin, the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
7
as a complication should be considered. This adverse drug effect may be a cause for ""failure of anticoagulation"" and also the reason for the development of limb ischemia noted in some of these patients. We would consider HIT even if the platelet count is in the normal range but has decreased more than 50% in the 4 to 14 days of commencing heparin treatment.

We also thank the authors for pointing out the different thresholds for transfusion, which is gratefully accepted and acknowledged in the final document. We also stress the importance of taking advice from the transfusion experts in this regard. The need for transfusion in COVID-19 patients is not high, however, because in our clinical experience bleeding is extremely uncommon because the hemostatic balance is shifted markedly toward thrombosis. We also acknowledge the important issue of iatrogenic anemia, something that has been highlighted by one of the authors for many years.
8
It may be that less frequent tests are ordered once the clinical situation improves is a possible solution.

The authors considered the possibility that the coagulopathy seen in COVID-19 might largely or even solely represent COVID-19 sepsis-induced hepatopathy. However, a recent retrospective study has described that although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19.
9
Another review also summarized that liver injury has often manifested as transient elevation of serum aminotransferases, and acute liver failure has been seldom reported in the available studies.
10
In addition, the level of antithrombin, which is also a predictor of liver reserve, is maintained within normal range in most of COVID patients during most of the hospitalization, according to the study by Tang et al.
5
It seems that changes of coagulation markers in COVID-19 cannot be attributed to liver failure based on current evidence.

Clinical assessment should clearly trump in all situations including COVID-19. But, laboratory markers may be relevant in raising suspicion of an underlying thrombotic problem in these patients in addition to a good clinical assessment. The diagnosis of TE is often overlooked for several reasons: respiratory symptoms attributed to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, chest radiography being unreliable for identifying thrombosis, inability to perform computed tomography scans because of practical issues, and the belief that prophylactic anticoagulation would prevent thrombosis in all cases. Laboratory markers may be helpful in these cases and also in early recognition of complications like HIT and even possibly noticing an improvement in patient status.

Abstract
Background:
COVID-19 is a new and highly contagious respiratory disease that has caused global spread, high case fatality rate in severe patients, and a huge medical burden due to invasive mechanical ventilation. The current diagnosis and treatment guidelines are still need to be improved, and more excellent clinical experience is needed to provide reference.
Methods:
We analyzed and summarized clinical data of 97 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (including 26 severe cases) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020,included laboratory examination results, imaging findings, treatment effect, prognosis , etc, in order to put forward prediction index of severe COVID-19 patients, principles of early intervention and methylprednisolone usages in COVID-19 patients.
Results:
1.Hypoxemia, hyperlactic acid, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia were prevalent in COVID-19 patients.The significant low lymphocyte count, hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, the persistent or worsen high CRP, high D-dimer, and high BNP, and the occurrence of hemoptysis and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viremia were important indicators for early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease progression.
2.Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID - 19, Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease.
3.Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 .
4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions:
1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.

Background:
In the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, Southwest Finland remained relatively spared. By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission.
Methods
For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson's chi-square test.
Results
Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p<0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87% versus 93%, p=0.09).
Discussion
OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care.

Whether this association of diabetes with COVID-19 mortality is independent of other comorbidities needs to be studied further.

Abstract

Background

Many studies on COVID-19 have reported diabetes to be associated with severe disease and mortality, however, the data is conflicting. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality and severity, and to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

We searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of diabetes was compared between patients with and without the composite endpoint of mortality or severity. Random effects model was used with odds ratio as the effect size. We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods.

Results

We included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37-2.64; p < 0.01). Diabetes was also associated with severe COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% CI: 2.09-3.62; p < 0.01). The combined corrected pooled odds ratio of mortality or severity was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.74-2.68; p < 0.01). The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%-10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).

Conclusions

Diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics. Further studies on the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications need to be done."

The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to immense strain on healthcare systems and workers. Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with acute neurological emergencies such as ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke in these patients may result from COVID-19 related complications or decompensation of previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders, or concurrent ischemic stroke from common stroke risk factors in a patient with COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions require emergent triage, intensive care, and mechanical thrombectomy. Management of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) requires special considerations in the current pandemic. Physicians must now account for prognosis of severe COVID-19, resource utilization, and risk of infection to healthcare workers when determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Here, we describe important prognostic factors including age, laboratory, and imaging findings to consider for MT selection and provide suggestions for taking care of patients with LVO and possible or confirmed COVID-19. It is recommended to perform MT in patients within the established guidelines, and consider a conservative approach in cases where there is clinical equipoise to minimize futile reperfusion. Lastly, we describe an illustrative case of a patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19.

Introduction

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in Wuhan, China (
1
). High rates of transmissibility, primarily through airborne droplets and aerosols and international travel, have led to a worldwide pandemic. The United States (US) leads the world in the number of COVID-19 cases, and there are growing concerns regarding the potential strain on its healthcare systems due to the intensive care needed for critically ill COVID-19 patients (
2
). Initial reports from other countries have already highlighted the stress of COVID-19 on their intensive care units (ICU) and resources (
3
). A recent case series of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Seattle, Washington reported a median ICU stay of 14 days and a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 10 days (
4
). With emergency departments and ICUs triaging and caring for increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, there is little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a tremendous impact on available resources for the triage and treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Here, we present an overview of COVID-19, recommendations for acute stroke care and treatment, and provide an illustrative case study of stroke in a COVID-19 positive patient.

COVID-19

Incidence and Mortality

Overall mortality rates in COVID-19 are dependent on gender, age, and underlying co-morbidities (
5
). Males are more likely to have severe symptoms and have a higher rate of mortality than females (
6
,
7
). In a study of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, 80% of those who died were 65 years or older (
8
). Patients between 60 and 69, 70 and 79, and above 80 years of age have a mortality rate of ~4, 10, and 21%, respectively (
5
,
9
). Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU have mortality rates of ~26% (
7
). Furthermore, patients with co-morbidities are considered high-risk, specifically those with hypertension (
10
). Of 1,625 deaths in Italy, 25% of patients had one co-morbidity, 25% had two, almost half had three or more co-morbidities, and <1% of patients did not have any co-morbidities (
5
). Shared risk factors for stroke and severe COVID-19 include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (
11
-
13
). In a Chinese study of 191 patients, hypertension (OR 3.05; 1.57-5.92), diabetes (OR 2.85; 1.35-6.05), and coronary artery disease (OR 21.4; 4.6-98.7) were independently associated with death from COVID-19 (
10
). Another study revealed that those with cardiovascular disease and an elevated troponin had a mortality rate of 69% (
14
).

Early studies of COVID-19 show that multiple factors contribute to high rates of mortality in selected populations. Patients from extended care facilities may have rates of mortality as high as 34% (
15
). In addition to considerations of age, co-morbidities, lab, and imaging findings, the MuLBSTA scoring system for viral pneumonia has been shown to be an effective predictor of 90-day mortality. Presence of multilobe infiltrates, lymphopenia (<= 0.8 x 10
9
/L), bacterial co-infection, smoking status, age, and hypertension are scored to give estimated mortality ranges from 2% to >69% (
16
).

Presentation

Symptoms

Mean time from contact exposure to development of COVID-19 symptoms is ~5 days, although a history of contact exposure or travel is not always present (
17
). The rate of asymptomatic carriers is currently unknown, but preliminary estimates range from 30 to 80% (
18
,
19
). Of those who develop clinical symptoms, 80% experience a mild clinical course (
20
). Presenting symptoms may include fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue, and less commonly nausea or vomiting, sputum production, and diarrhea (
21
,
22
). In one study, median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 7 days, to development of dyspnea was 8 days, and to severe respiratory distress was 9 days (
23
). Patients with severe COVID-19 may develop severe respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, sepsis, secondary infection, coagulopathy, or acute cardiac injury at presentation or within a few days of admission (
10
). Patients who have longer times from symptom onset to hospitalization or present with respiratory distress are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 (
24
).

Neurological Findings

Initial reports from Wuhan, China revealed that ~36.4% of severe COVID-19 patients develop neurological symptoms including impaired level of consciousness, headache, dizziness, seizures, dysgeusia, anosmia, dysphagia, and muscle pain (
28
,
29
). Although patients with neurological symptoms are more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease, many present with neurological symptoms as the only presenting symptom of COVID-19. Anosmia is an early, common, specific, and often initial symptom of COVID-19, which may improve with resolution of illness (
30
). Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported in over 85% of patients with infection (
31
). CNS involvement has been hypothesized to occur from hematogenous spread or direct involvement of the olfactory bulb and retrograde neuronal invasion (
32
,
33
). Case reports of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and acute myelitis in COVID-19 patients have recently been described (
29
,
34
-
37
). COVID-19 has also been detected in CSF and long term neurological sequelae of COVID-19 remain unknown (
38
).

Stroke

Ischemic stroke has been reported to occur in ~5% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital, which included patients with large vessel stenosis, small vessel disease, and cardioembolic strokes (
39
). Recent reports have emerged of patients younger than 50 years with LVO with minimal or no symptoms of COVID-19 (
40
). However, most patients with stroke (ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage) are more likely to be older and present with severe COVID-19 symptoms (
39
). Mortality rates of patients with severe COVID-19 and a history of cerebrovascular disease range from 20% (6 of 30) to 100% (7 of 7) (
6
,
12
). Multiple risk factors for severe COVID-19 have been identified, but cerebrovascular disease has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in those with COVID-19 (
39
).

Numerous theories have emerged regarding the pathogenesis of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. For patients with stroke, a proinflammatory state triggered by cytokines may contribute to vascular endothelial injury or a hypercoagulable state which may result in extensive thrombosis and microvascular dysfunction (
41
-
43
). These hypotheses are supported by elevated D-dimers in patients with severe COVID-19, anecdotal reports of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and normal coronary arteries (
44
), and reports of limb ischemia (
43
,
45
). Furthermore, use of heparin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 (
46
). Lung biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 has shown small vessel hyperplasia, vessel wall thickening, luminal stenosis, occlusion, and micro-thrombosis (
47
).

Ischemic stroke and COVID-19 may occur concurrently either from common stroke pathologies such as atrial fibrillation in patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, as a complication of severe COVID-19 pathology such as hypercoagulability or a proinflammatory state, or due to worsening hypoxia and decompensation in patients with previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders such as carotid occlusion or moyamoya disease/syndrome.

Acute Stroke Care Considerations

Acute stroke care continues to be a vital part of emergency care, even amid a pandemic or crisis. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) has provided temporary emergency guidance for stroke centers during the current crisis which includes admission of stable stroke patients directly to step down units instead of the ICU and encourages the use of telemedicine for acute stroke patients (
48
). Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT) within 24 h from ""last seen normal"" time (
49
-
55
). Although the use of intravenous tPA for AIS has not been studied in patients with COVID-19, its use is imperative for eligible patients with AIS. Given the current crisis, selection of patients for MT poses new challenges and requires refinement of established protocols. Recently published recommendations from the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) recommend that MT should be performed in patients in which there is high-quality data to support benefit (
56
). The decision to perform MT in patients outside established guidelines should be pursued in the context of resource availability and balanced against the risks and benefits to the patient as well as the treating health-care providers.

Drastic changes have occurred during the current COVID-19 crisis. Treatment goals have evolved from providing the best clinical care for patients to providing the best clinical care for patients without overutilization of resources or compromising healthcare worker safety. Treatment of life-threatening, time urgent conditions such as AIS and STEMI have always focused on providing the correct treatment for those who may benefit as early as possible. The concern of contact with possible COVID-19 positive patients may result in delayed treatment and triage, which has already been reported in China as door-to-device times for STEMI have increased by 25 min (
57
). Treatment of LVO will likely see similar increases in times as regional, hospital bypass, and mobile stroke unit protocols change, and healthcare workers don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE).

MT in patients older than 80 years of age has not been extensively evaluated in randomized clinical studies. In the HERMES meta-analysis, patients over 80 years had a mortality rate of 15.3% and a good clinical outcome in 29.8% (
58
). Real-world experience of patients undergoing MT over 80 years of age revealed a good functional outcome in 21% and a higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage than younger patients (
59
). Mortality in patients over 80 is significantly higher than younger patients (33 vs. 14%) (
60
). Patients over 80 years of age also have high rates of futile reperfusion (50%) (
61
). Although rates of mortality are higher in older patients, there remains a benefit in terms of functional clinical outcome in patients without COVID-19. The high rate of mortality of COVID-19 in this age group warrants careful evaluation of risks and benefits when mechanical thrombectomy is considered.

Screening and Pre-hospital Care

Early suspicion of COVID-19 in patients is vital for stroke team preparation. Screening for fever, contact with COVID + patients, and recent cough should ideally be performed by 911 dispatchers and EMT should be informed prior to on-scene arrival. For inpatient stroke codes, clinical information can be obtained from the patient's chart and nursing staff prior to in-person assessment. Telemedicine can be utilized both in the emergency department as well as for inpatient stroke codes to minimize provider contact with potential COVID-19 patients. Details of providing hyperacute stroke code care have been recently published (
62
). Urgent lab draws and rapid bedside testing for COVID-19 should be performed on arrival or during an inpatient code stroke, and if COVID-19 is suspected or clinical history cannot be obtained accurately, a CT chest may be performed prior to transport to the neuroangiography suite (NAS) (
63
).

Patient Selection

Prior to selecting patients for MT, risk factors for severe disease and mortality from COVID-19 and potential risks to healthcare workers need to be thoroughly evaluated. Patients for whom there is clinical equipoise, such as those with anterior or posterior circulation LVO and low NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale), distal occlusions, low ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score), or minimal to moderate penumbral tissue, should be managed conservatively. Patients with an ASPECTS score of 5 or less have poor functional outcomes, high rates of futile reperfusion, and should be managed conservatively in the current climate (
64
,
65
). Patients with low NIHSS and LVO, should be monitored closely, given possible subsequent clinical deterioration from COVID-19 related hypoxia or altered hemodynamics. In cases of subsequent clinical deterioration, MT should be performed if they meet established LVO guidelines. Institutions enrolling patients with clinical equipoise for MT in randomized clinical trials should halt enrollment and provide medical management in these patients for now.

Although LVO patients with clinical equipoise may be managed conservatively, denial of MT for patients within the established guidelines may lead to poorer clinical outcomes, longer hospital stays, increased need for post-acute care and long-term skilled facility beds, and increased long-term cost of care and resource utilization (
56
,
66
). With appropriate precautions, MT for patients younger than 80 years with LVO and suspected COVID-19 who may potentially benefit is a reasonable approach. In patients younger than 80 years with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19, use of pre-treatment thrombectomy scores such as HIAT2 (
67
), THRIVE (
68
), and PRE (
69
) in conjunction with COVID-19 predictors may provide important insight to guide discussions of treatment goals and expectations of long-term clinical outcome (See
Figure 1
for proposed algorithm for patients with suspected LVO).

FIGURE 1

Figure 1
. Proposed algorithm for AIS patient triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-hospital screening for symptoms of COVID-19 should be performed by the 911 dispatcher. EMS implements region-specific bypass protocols for patients with suspected large vessel occlusion. Pre-hospital notification allows for room and team preparation. Immediate lab draws and bedside testing for COVID-19 in CT suite followed by routine stroke imaging; if suspected COVID-19 or unable to obtain history, consider CT chest. If there is clinical equipoise, patients should be managed conservatively. For patients with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19, consider prognostic scoring. Early discussion of treatment goals may be appropriate for patients with severe COVID-19 and a high risk of mortality. For patients selected for MT, consider intubation in a negative pressure room before transferring to the neuroangiography suite.

Anesthesia and Sedation

Conscious sedation can be performed in patients in whom there is a low risk of intra-procedural conversion to general anesthesia and can maintain sufficient oxygenation without the use of supplemental oxygen. Randomized clinical trials have shown that general anesthesia is safe for patients undergoing MT and should be considered for all MT patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (
70
,
71
). Patients with respiratory failure, need for oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO
2
>= 92% and PaO
2
> 60 mmHg, or active cough should be intubated in a negative pressure room before transport to the NAS (
72
,
73
). Extension tubing should be set up to avoid circuit disconnections or ventilator transfers once in the NAS. Providers should aim to avoid suctioning during the procedure and non-intubated patients should be provided masks to wear during the procedure.

Neuroangiography Suite

Negative pressure rooms should ideally have self-closing doors with a negative pressure anteroom to allow for patient transport and an area for donning and doffing. Negative pressure rooms provide a pressure differential between the room and surrounding environment and ensure that the total mechanically supplied air is less than that of the total mechanically exhausted air. This can be achieved by placing a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter exhausting clean air back to the air system or through a window to the atmosphere and sealing any other exhaust/return air ducts. A pressure monitor should be visible in the room to ensure a pressure differential of -2.5 Pa has been reached. This can be achieved by increasing the flow on the HEPA machine and should provide at least 12 air changes per hour (
74
). Due to time constraints and architectural challenges in most NAS, it may be reasonable to perform MT in a designated negative pressure COVID swing single plane suite that can be shared with interventional cardiology and/or interventional radiology.

Mechanical Thrombectomy Procedure and Room Set-Up

Providers should perform all MT with the presumption that patients are COVID-19 positive and wear standard PPE (surgical cap, eye protection, full gown, gloves, shoe covers) and an N95 mask. Prior to MT, all unnecessary equipment should be removed from the NAS and all remaining equipment such as anesthesia machines and other surfaces should be covered with a protective covering. Only equipment and staff necessary for the procedure should be in the room at the onset of the procedure. Supporting staff should be identified as ""hot"" (exposed to patient) or ""cold"" (not exposed to patient) prior to the procedure. A ""cold"" nurse or technician should be available in full PPE in the control room in case additional supplies are needed or if the ""hot"" technician becomes contaminated. Simulation training with the entire team should be performed to help identify early issues and improve team preparation. If emergent intubation is required during the procedure, all personal should leave the room except those essential for immediate patient care. Signs should be placed on the NAS indicating an ongoing procedure on COVID-19 positive or suspected patient. Current SNIS recommendations include early transition of stroke patients to the step-down unit to minimize the use of ICU beds (
56
).

When negative pressure rooms are not available, the use of an anteroom is more important, and ""foot traffic"" near the neuroangiography suite should be minimized. In positive pressure neuroangiography suites, environmental services should wait 207 min or run a HEPA filter in the room for about 20 min before entering the room (
75
). Terminal cleaning with an EPA registered, hospital-grade disinfectant must be performed between patients. This includes, but is not limited, to disinfecting the floor and walls, all surfaces, especially high touch areas, cables, anesthesia machines, and trash receptacles. The thorough cleaning of the neuroangiography suite often takes about an hour before the room can be turned around.

Case Study

Recently, a 75-year-old man with right gaze deviation and left arm drift (initial NIHSS 12) presented to our hospital. The patient was identified by bypass protocols to have a suspected LVO based on the Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation (RACE) score and was brought directly to our comprehensive stroke center. Initial pre-hospital page from emergency medical services (EMS) identified the patient as suspected COVID-19 positive with recent respiratory symptoms as well as ""RACE positive."" On arrival, the patient was met by one nurse, CT technician, and physician in PPE. In addition to neuroimaging, a CT chest (
Figure 2
) was performed which revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. Vascular imaging revealed a distal right MCA M3 branch occlusion with matching infarct, and labs revealed an elevated troponin (0.26), elevated AST (50), bilirubin (1.3), LDH (523), CRP (27), ferritin (393), and procalcitonin (2.2). Given the lack of clinical-core mismatch, reperfusion therapy was not offered. The patient required intubation and within 2 days, the patient passed away from respiratory failure and shock.

Conclusion

COVID-19 has placed an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems and resources. Our review summarizes the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and provides prognostic features of severe COVID-19 infection to help determine the risks and benefits of performing MT. While the provided algorithm accounts for many considerations for MT in the current climate, the decision to perform MT is complex and should be individualized. Furthermore, there is a lack of literature on outcomes of MT in LVO patients with COVID-19 and these opinions are based on expert views and anecdotal reports.

Although stroke physicians and neurointerventionalists may not be at the forefront of the COVID-19 battle, we must work to support and protect all other healthcare workers and their families, minimize futile reperfusion, reduce neuroangiography suite turnover, limit PPE use, and ensure that all ventilators and other resources are used for patients who would most likely benefit. In a time when most systems are overwhelmed, canceling elective procedures and minimizing non-urgent diagnostic procedures will free up manpower to take care of COVID-19 patients and reduce healthcare workers' burden. We must continue to advocate for our stroke patients and intervene on patients when we are confident that the risks taken, for the patient as well as the healthcare team are less than the benefits.

The rapid transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting over 372.757 people worldwide. An increasing proportion of cases manifest as severe disease, characterised by respiratory disfunction and multi-organ failure. Previous studies have suggested the mechanisms of cytokine storm as a cause for progression and have measured associations between IL-6 levels and COVID-19 fatality. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to perform an evidence-based investigation on the role of IL-6 measurement to predict disease progression. Our results indicate that IL-6 may be important in identifying disease progression among COVID-19 infected patients.

Abstract

Mounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of
coronavirus
disease 2019 (
COVID-19
) involves a hyperinflammatory response predisposing patients to thromboembolic disease and acute respiratory distress. In the setting of severe blunt
trauma
, damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through similar pathways to
COVID-19
. As such, patients with
COVID-19
sustaining orthopaedic
trauma
injuries may have an amplified response to the traumatic insult due to their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. These patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability. Herein, we review the current evidence regarding pathogenesis of
COVID-19
and its implications on the management of orthopaedic

Background and purpose

To date, no study has attempted to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the incidence and treatment of acute stroke.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator. A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the centre with the largest case volume.

Results

Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments [40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)]. No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%). The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%),
P
= 0.034. There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis amongst stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.

Conclusion

These results suggest that the overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window. Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). The outbreak was identified in China in December 2019 and then spread to Europe in January 2020. The first three cases in Europe were reported in France on 24 January [
1
]. Epidemic response measures were triggered in France on 1 March and gradually developed until 17 March when nationwide lockdown was enforced, with strict home confinement of the entire population.

Alsace was the first French region affected by the outbreak. It is a region in the east of France with a population of approximately 1.9 million people. On 31 March there were 2004 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (of which 410 were in intensive care units) and 591 reported deaths [
2
].

Since the onset of the pandemic, several groups reported marked and unexplained decreases in the volume of patients with acute cardiovascular pathologies apparently unrelated to COVID-19 infection, such as myocardial infarction [
3
,
4
] and acute ischaemic stroke [
5
,
6
]. However, up to now, no study has attempted to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on incidence and treatment rates of acute stroke.

The aim was to perform a detailed analysis of variations in the acute stroke pathway activity for the Alsace region, during the first month of the outbreak, using the same time period from 2019 as a comparator.

Materials and methods

A retrospective review was performed of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region, for 1-31 March 2020 and 1-31 March 2019. For each centre the number of patients processed as stroke alerts, the number of admissions in the stroke units, the number of acute revascularization treatments [intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT)] as well as time delays for treated patients were collected. In addition, a more detailed analysis within the centre with the largest case volume (Strasbourg) was performed, collecting characteristics and final diagnosis for all patients processed as stroke alerts and characteristics and final diagnosis of all patients admitted on the stroke unit.

Brief description of the stroke pathway in the Alsace region

There are three hospitals with stroke units in the region, of which two have endovascular treatment (EVT) facilities. The north of the region (population approximately 1.1 million) is covered by Strasbourg (EVT), whilst Colmar (EVT) and Mulhouse are situated in the south (population approximately 800 000 people). Patients are accepted as stroke alerts following a telephone consultation between the paramedic/physician in the field and the on-call neurologist, if there are symptoms suggestive of stroke dating <6 h from last seen well (up to 24 h in selected cases). Stroke alerts bypass the emergency department and are seen directly by the on-call neurologist in the Radiology Department, before imaging. All three centres use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patient selection.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are presented as median with interquartile range and were compared using the Mann-Whitney
U
test. The normality of the distributions was assessed graphically and using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables are presented as numbers with percentages and were compared using Pearson's
kh
2
test or the Fisher exact test depending on theoretical numbers. A
P
value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, Version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

The study was approved by the institutional ethical review board of Strasbourg University Hospitals (reference CE-2020-70, 29 April 2020). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the board waived the need for signed informed consent.

Results

Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts (174 vs. 288 in 2019) and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments (34 vs. 51 in 2019; 40.9% fewer IVT and 27.6% fewer MT). No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (159 vs. 160 in 2019 - 0.6%). Table

The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 - 34/159 (21.3%) compared to 51/160 (31.8%) in March 2019,
P
= 0.034. Amongst patients who benefited from IVT or MT, there were no significant differences in pre-hospital, intra-hospital time delays or severity of clinical symptoms (Table
2
).

Table 2.

Age and distribution of final diagnosis (cerebrovascular disease or stroke mimic) amongst stroke alerts did not differ significantly between the two time periods (Table
3
). The time interval from hospital admission to imaging was not significantly longer in 2020.

Similarly, there was no significant difference of final diagnosis for patients admitted on the stroke unit, nor of age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores amongst patients admitted for ischaemic strokes (Table
4
).

Discussion

During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak a marked reduction in stroke alerts, IVT and MT, was observed with a relatively stable number of stroke unit admissions. This result suggests that the overall incidence of stroke remained stable but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.

Two centres from northern Italy reported similar findings. Baracchini
et al
. [
5
] observed a reduction of 26% in IVT and 30% in MT, as well as onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes. They also note a 50% reduction in minor strokes, transient ischaemic attacks and transfers from primary stroke units. The authors do not provide further details for these findings and the number of stroke unit admissions and study periods are not specified. In the editorial of Morelli
et al
. [
6
] the authors note a marked reduction in emergency admissions with symptoms of acute stroke - only six admissions between 21 February and 25 March 2020, compared to a monthly average of 51 cases in previous years.

Several factors could potentially explain this phenomenon. First, some patients with milder neurological symptoms might delay or avoid medical consultation due to fear of contamination. This could potentially account for a reduction in stroke alerts but less so in IVT or MT, as patients in this group generally do not have mild deficits. Secondly, care systems, and in particular pre-hospital and hospital emergency services, are undergoing significant pressures due to the volume of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, protocols are burdened by personal protection measures across all phases of patient care. This might induce supplemental delays or errors during patient triage and transport, thus reducing the proportion of patients eligible for acute treatments. In our region, stroke care and interventional treatments remained available around the clock; the effects of the outbreak could potentially become even more significant if stroke pathways are affected or even interrupted by illness amongst the medical personnel or redistribution to other departments. Albeit not statistically significant, in our study longer in-hospital delays were observed for patients who underwent IVT or MT. This is probably explained by additional anamnesis and clinical examination needed in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, as well as by the additional personal protection measures taken to avoid contamination of medical personnel.

Thirdly, epidemic response measures might also represent a contributing factor. Home confinement reduces social connections, especially in the elderly population. Isolation can lead to delayed notification of emergency services and can thus contribute towards a reduced proportion of patients who present within the therapeutic time window.

From a physiopathological standpoint, an increase in the incidence of ischaemic stroke should be being seen. Initial findings point towards a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients. High levels of thrombosis and inflammation serum markers, such as D-dimers, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, have been reported [
7
-
9
].

In a single-centre Chinese cohort [
9
] of 221 patients with COVID-19, 11 (5%) developed acute ischaemic stroke, one (0.5%) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and one (0.5%) cerebral haemorrhage. In our centre [
10
] brain MRI was performed for 13 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Three cases (23%) had evidence of acute or subacute ischaemic stroke. Of note, these patients did not have focal signs suggestive of stroke; they underwent MRI because of unexplained encephalopathic features. These findings suggest that ischaemic stroke might be frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, but a significant proportion of cases are not detected because clinical symptoms are masked by the severity of respiratory features and sedation.

The strength of the present study lies in the fact that data were collected from all stroke units in the region and there were no organizational changes between the two time periods. Consecutively, the results should be representative for the total number of strokes for this geographical area.

There are, however, a number of limitations, however. The analysis was restricted to a period of 31 days at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the epidemic continues, the care systems may adapt and tendencies might change. Furthermore, our results might not be representative for other countries or regions with different stroke care protocols and geographical specificities.

CONCLUSION

During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak, a marked reduction in stroke alerts, IVT and MT rates and a relatively stable number of stroke unit admissions were observed. This suggests that the overall incidence of stroke remained the same but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window. Further research is warranted to better characterize this phenomenon. Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed, in order to mitigate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.

Purpose:
Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving pandemic. It is well-known that pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infection due to immune and anatomic factors. Therefore, the viral pandemic might affect the reproductive health and maternity services especially in low-resource countries.

Materials and methods:
In this article, we tried to highlight the impact of COVID-19 on reproductive health and maternity health services in low resource countries with emphasis on adapting some of the published best practice recommendations to suit a struggling environment.

Conclusion:
Pregnant women residing in low resource countries represent a uniquely vulnerable group in epidemics due to several factors. Maternity services in low resource countries are adapting to provide antenatal and postnatal care amidst a rapidly shifting health system environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lung pathology seen in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows marked microvascular thrombosis and haemorrhage linked to extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation that shares features with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). We have termed the lung-restricted vascular immunopathology associated with COVID-19 as diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, which in its early stages is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations (reflecting pulmonary vascular bed thrombosis with fibrinolysis) and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations (reflecting emergent ventricular stress induced by pulmonary hypertension) in the face of normal fibrinogen and platelet levels are key early features of severe pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy related to COVID-19. Extensive immunothrombosis over a wide pulmonary vascular territory without confirmation of COVID-19 viraemia in early disease best explains the adverse impact of male sex, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis, which might unmask subclinical cardiovascular disease and is distinct from the MAS and disseminated intravascular coagulation that is more familiar to rheumatologists."

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originated in the Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in November 2019 and has since been declared a pandemic by the WHO. COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory specimens is considered the reference by which to diagnose COVID-19. However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered. Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms. In this article, we review the typical imaging findings in COVID-19, the differential diagnoses, and common complications."

Abstract

We read with interest the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 (
1
). We applaud this group's efforts in releasing a timely article on the pandemic impacting all regions of the globe. While we agree that this interim guidance addresses important considerations for monitoring the disease process, we believe that the proposed treatment strategy of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to treat severe COVID-19 coagulopathy is an unconvincing strategy. Patients that are critically ill with COVID-19 have hallmark signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)(
2
), and as noted in the ISTH interim guidance and our own clinical practice, thrombosis is the overwhelming phenotype with rare bleeding complications. We address this concern with the existing data on the severe hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 victims and advocate for consideration of systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to prevent life threatening micro- and macrovascular thrombosis to mitigate their associated consequences, up to and including progression of respiratory and organ failure.

A male patient, 42 years old, came to emergency department with weakness in his right arm for two days as his main complain. He also had face drop on the right side, cough, and shortness of breath. He had a history of hyperthyroid and type II diabetes mellitus. The brain CT Scan showed a lacunar infarct in the left lentiform nucleus. Patient had an nasopharynx and oropharynx swab to be checked for the presence of COVID-19 and the result was positive.The pathophysiology of stroke in COVID-19 include the hyperactivation of inflammatory factors that causes a fatal inflammatory storm. It also cause a damage of coagulation system which causing the D-dimer and platelet abnormalities, hypercoagulability from critical illness and cardioembolism from virus-related cardiac injury. Moreover, COVID-19 may cause a direct role in viral infection in central nervous system. In conclusion, ischemic stroke can be present along with COVID-19."

Abstract

Early clinical evidence suggests that severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are frequently characterized by hyperinflammation, imbalance of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and a particular form of vasculopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, and intravascular coagulopathy. In this paper, we present an immunothrombosis model of COVID-19. We discuss the underlying pathogenesis and the interaction between multiple systems, resulting in propagation of immunothrombosis, which through investigation in the coming weeks, may lead to both an improved understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and identification of innovative and efficient therapeutic targets to reverse the otherwise unfavorable clinical outcome of many of these patients."

Abstract

Background

The severe inflammatory state secondary to Covid-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer as well as low fibrinogen.

Aims

Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of Covid-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations. Plasma was evaluated for the other parameters of hemostasis.

Results

TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased R and K values, and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal). Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased. C-reactive protein was increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n=11) were increased. Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased.

Conclusion

The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.

Abstract

Early reports of COVID-19 clinical features describe a hypercoagulable state, and recent guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin, but this would be contraindicated in the presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We address the key clinical question whether HIT is also present during COVID-19. We report 3 cases of thrombocytopenia with anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies among 16 intubated COVID-19 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, a higher than expected incidence of 19%. Each patient had evidence of thrombosis (pulmonary embolism, upper extremity venous thromboses, and skin necrosis, respectively). The serotonin release assay confirmed HIT in one case, and two cases were negative. We believe this is the first reported case of HIT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition that the thrombocytopenia represented HIT in the confirmed case was delayed. We recommend clinicians monitor platelet counts closely during heparin therapy, with a low threshold to evaluate for HIT.

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Elevated D-dimer is a predictor of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients
and heparin use during in-hospital stay has been associated with decreased mortality. COVID-
19 patient autopsies have revealed thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting intravascular
coagulation as a prominent feature of organ failure in these patients. Interestingly, in COVID-
19, pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia corroborating the
hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of
respiratory failure.
METHODS: We describe a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Sirio-
Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo-Brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses tailored to
clinical severity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased significantly over the 72 hours following
the start of anticoagulation, from 254(+-90) to 325(+-80), p=0.013, and 81% of the patients were
discharged home within a mean time of 11.4 (+-7.9) days. Most mechanically ventilated
patients (67%) were extubated within 12.5(+- 5.7) days. There were no bleeding complications
or fatal events.
Even though this uncontrolled case series does not offer absolute proof of DIC as the
underlying mechanism of respiratory failure in COVID-19, patient's positive response to
tailored dose heparinization contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanism of the disease and provides valuable information for the treatment of these very
sick patients while we await the results of further prospective controlled studies.

INTRODUCTION:
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, disease severity has been
linked to markers of coagulation disturbances such as prothrombin time prolongation,
elevated fibrin degradation products, reduced platelet count, and specially to elevated
1-7
D dimer . Higher levels of D dimer and the presence of other coagulation
disturbances have been independently associated with development of respiratory
8
failure and death in patients with COVID-19 . The use of heparin, particularly in those
patients with more pronounced elevations of D dimer and in those with elevated
4
sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) score, has been associated with a better prognosis
8
. Diabetic patients, whose levels of D dimer are greater than those of non-diabetic
9
patients, have also been shown to have a worse prognosis regarding COVID-19 .
Moreover, D dimer levels have helped differentiate severe COVID-19 associated
10
pneumonia from that caused by other viruses .
Over the past 2 months it has been consistently shown that SARS-Cov-2 causes
a cytokine storm that ultimately leads to the activation of the coagulation cascade,
4 8 11
causing thrombotic phenomena . Similarly to what happens in severe sepsis, the
widespread deposition of intravascular clots compromises adequate blood supply,
12
contributing to organ failure .
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to severe infection is
classically associated with gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, malaria and
haemorrhagic fevers, but other viruses, such as dengue (an hemorrhagic virus), SARS-
CoV and MERS-CoV, can also be responsible for systemic activation of intravascular
13 14
coagulation .

Furthermore, in contrast to the characteristic stiffening of the lung usually seen
in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in COVID19 patients the severe
hypoxemia observed is accompanied by near normal pulmonary compliance, especially
15
in early stages . Autopsy findings from COVID-19 patients show microthrombi in the
16-18
pulmonary microvasculature suggesting that ventilation-perfusion mismatch due
to capillary obstruction could be a pivotal feature in the refractory hypoxemia
presented by these patients. The anatomical distribution of this peripheral vascular
bed mirrors the predominantly distal and patchy distribution of the radiological
19
infiltrates .
In one of our first COVID-19 patients we noticed a concomitance of peripheral
ischaemia (acro-ischemia) with the onset of respiratory distress, an observation that
led us to consider the hypothesis that the normal compliance respiratory failure might
actually be due to extensive pulmonary capillary obstruction, and that systemic
disseminated intravascular coagulation might be playing a significant role in hypoxemia
and outcome of COVID-19 patients.
The treatment of DIC consists in slowing down the coagulation cascade by using
low doses of anticoagulation, alongside vigorous specific treatment of the underlying
2
disorder. We therefore considered adding early heparin therapy to our standard care .
The present study is a description of the outcome of the first 27 COVID-19 patients we
treated as DIC in the course of the disease.

METHODS
This study is a case series of 27 consecutive Covid-19 patients seen by our team
st th
in Sirio-Libanes Hospital - Sao Paulo, Brazil, between March 21 and April 12 , 2020.
The study is registered under number 1678 at the Sirio-Libanes Hospital and informed
consent was waived.
All patients with COVID-19 admitted by our team received enoxaparin 0,5mg/kg
SC every 24 hours. Patients with a creatinine clearance under 30 mL/min received
subcutaneous unfractionated heparin at a dose of 5,000 units every 8 or 6 hours. If an
abrupt decrease in oxygenation or an increase in D Dimer levels was observed,
enoxaparin dose was raised to 0,5 mg/kg SC every 12 hours and, in the event of
thrombotic phenomena or worsening hypoxia, the dose was further increased to 1
mg/kg SC every 12 hours. Patients with a BMI (body mass index) of 35 or higher were
also considered for the higher dose regimen. Patients in shock were treated from the
beginning with intravenous heparin, targeting an APTT ratio around 1.5 to 2.0 times
the normal range. If patients presented any acute thrombotic event, heparin dosing
was increased to obtain an APTT approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times the normal range.
All patients received a 10-day course of azithromycin (500mg on day 1, then
20
250mg daily) . Methylprednisolone 40mg daily was initiated if a worsening in the
radiological pattern accompanied by an increase in serum LDH levels was observed. If
the patient presented subsequent rise in C-reactive protein, we actively searched for
secondary infection and promptly initiated antibiotics.

RESULTS
We followed a total of 27 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, all
confirmed by PCR. Seventy percent were male, their mean age was 56 +- 17 years,
2
mean BMI was 28.8 +- 6 kg/m , and comorbidities were present in 56% of them (table
3-7
1). The mean WHO classification score at admittance was 4.0 +- 1,2 (Figure 1). Entry
CT scans showed radiologic infiltrates compromising up to 25% of lung area in 22% of
patients, 25-50% of lung area in 48% of patients, and 30% of patients presented
infiltrates in over half of lung parenchyma. Symptoms started at an average of 9.6 +- 4.0
days prior to hospitalization, and the anticoagulation protocol was initiated at an
average of 3,4 +- 4,0 days after admission. Nineteen patients received
methylprednisolone in the course of the disease. The average level of D Dimer during
the follow up period was 1,637+- 1,967 ng/mL FEU, with a peak value of 3,544 +- 5,914
ng/mL FEU. Only 5 patients (19%) never had a D dimer level above 500 ng/mL FEU. Six
patients received only the prophylactic dosage of heparin or enoxaparin; three
patients started already with enoxaparin 0,5 mg/Kg twice and were kept on this
dosage and in 18 patients' dosages were escalated to either full EV heparin or
enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice a day.

Of the 27 consecutive patients, 22 (81%) were discharged from hospital after an
average of 11.4 (+- 7.9) days. One patient was transferred to another hospital on the
4th day and lost follow-up. Nine patients (33%) were admitted to ICU, 6 (66%) of
which have already been discharged to the ward after an average of 13.2(+-6.7) days.
Eight patients (30%) required intubation, and 5 patients have already been successfully
weaned after an average 12.5 (+- 5.7) days of mechanical ventilation. Of the patients
still under mechanical ventilation, 2 required a tracheostomy.
Interestingly enough, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) performed in
four patients, showed an increase in a-angle, amplitude 10 minutes after clotting time
(A10) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) pointing to a persistent hypercoagulability

DISCUSSION
Our results suggest the important role of disseminated intravascular
coagulation as one of the main mechanisms of organ failure in COIVID-19 and the
potential response to early anticoagulation therapy.
The significant improvement observed in oxygen exchange and clinical
symptoms observed in these COVID19 patients in response to the anticoagulation
points to a potential role for systematic use of heparin in the treatment of such
patients. The high incidence of thrombotic events that has been reported in COVID-19
22
patients , as well as the fact that similar observations were reported in the other
13 14
recent coronavirus outbreaks , further corroborate with this line of reasoning. This
48
is not surprising, as severe cases of COVID19 meet the laboratory criteria of DIC of
thrombotic pattern, in which fibrinogen does not drop and prothrombotic phenomena
23
override the haemorrhagic ones . The histological findings of thrombi in the
17
microvasculature documented in the autopsies of COVID-19 patients , further support
the belief that in COVID-19 we are facing a thrombotic organ-failure type of DIC that
23 24
should be treated with heparin . This might explain the previous findings of an
4
association between heparin use during hospital stay and a reduced mortality .
Thromboelastography showing a pattern of hypercoagulability despite the use
25
of heparin during the course of viral diseases has been previously reported . In fact,
26
many viruses known to induce a state of hypercoagulability have a similar pattern of
27
disease, including the timeframe of clinical manifestations , suggesting a common
pattern of response.
Although the principle that early anticoagulation therapy for sepsis probably
causes uncontrolled immunothrombosis and pathological systemic DIC, since the

presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and hypercoagulation in DIC localize
the infection, this is well described for bacteria but not for virus, where virus-induced
28
NETs could be a pathogenic mediator .
The PaO2/FiO 2 ratio improvement observed in our patients after starting
heparin is in agreement with the idea of a significant perfusion component explaining
the mechanism of respiratory failure with the distinct pattern of marked hypoxia and
preserved lung compliance that characterizes severe COVID19 patients. It has been
argued that this could be secondary to the loss of lung perfusion regulation and
16
hypoxic vasoconstriction , but the clinical response to heparin rather suggests hypoxia
due to extensive clogging of pulmonary microcirculation. Interestingly the use of tissue
Plasminogen Activator (tPA) has been shown to promote a non-sustained elevation of
29
PaO2/FiO2 ratio . In our opinion, given the marked hypercoagulability seen in these
patients - and again in accordance with the autopsy findings - judicious tailoring of
heparin doses is needed to prevent capillary reocclusion while avoiding the risks of
bleeding complications.
The fact that this is a retrospective study without a control arm does not yet
allow us to definitively conclude that heparin in tailored doses should be systematically
employed in all COVID19 patients. Nonetheless, our findings in this early group of
patients certainly provide food for thought and perhaps a rationale to justify using a
readily available and well-known drug such as heparin to ameliorate the dim prognosis
of such sick patients while we await the more solid data on this subject.

Hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 with a focus on platelet count

Abstract

Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) which rapidly evolved from an outbreak in Wuhan, China into a pandemic that has resulted in over millions of infections and over hundreds of thousands of mortalities worldwide. Various coagulopathies have been reported in association with COVID-19, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), local microthrombi, venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombotic complications, and thrombo-inflammation. There is a plethora of publications and conflicting data on hematological and hemostatic derangements in COVID-19 with some data suggesting the link to disease progress, severity and/or mortality. There is also growing evidence of potentially useful clinical biomarkers to predict COVID-19 progression and disease outcomes. Of those, a link between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity or mortality was suggested. In this opinion report, we examine the published evidence of hematological and hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 and the interrelated SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, with a focussed discussion on platelet count alterations. We explore whether thrombocytopenia could be a potential disease biomarker and we provide recommendations for future studies in this regard.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) which rapidly evolved from an outbreak in Wuhan, China into a pandemic that has resulted in over millions of infections and over hundreds of thousands of mortalities worldwide [
1
]. While COVID-19 is primarily a viral respiratory illness, it can have systemic manifestations, most notably coagulation impairments, in those with severe disease. COVID-19 has been associated with various coagulopathies including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), local microthrombi, venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombotic complications, and thrombo-inflammation [
2
-
9
]. There has been a plethora of publications on hematological and hemostatic derangements in COVID-19 with data supporting the link to disease progress, severity and mortality. With a rapidly evolving pandemic such as this, it not uncommon/unexpected to see contradicting, incomplete, or quickly outdated information. There is also growing evidence of potentially useful clinical biomarkers to predict COVID-19 progression and disease outcomes. Of those, a link between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity or related mortality was suggested. In this opinion report, and based on current evidence, we examine the published evidence of the hematological and hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 and the interrelated SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, with a focussed discussion on platelet count. We explore whether thrombocytopenia could be a potential clinical indicator of severe disease or poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and we provide recommendations for future studies in this regard.

Hematological/hemostatic lab abnormalities in COVID-19

Hematological/hemostatic derangements in COVID-19 are common, with more profound changes seen in those with more severe disease [
6
,
10
-
18
]. Based on reported coagulation abnormalities, Favaloro and Lippi recommend the following minimum hematologic testing panels: complete blood count, routine coagulation tests (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]), fibrinogen, and D-dimer to evaluate patients with COVID-19 [
15
]. With regard to blood cell counts, patients with COVID-19 can present with lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and/or leukopenia [
12
-
14
,
18
-
20
]. Lymphopenia is one of the most common cell count derangements in COVID-19 and may be an early prognostic indicator [
12
,
13
,
20
-
24
]. Out of 1,099 patients with COVID-19 studied by Guan et al., 83.2% of patients presented with lymphocytopenia [
12
]. In multiple other studies, lymphopenia was found in the majority of COVID-19 cases [
13
,
20
-
23
]. Huang et al. and Wang et al. found an association between lymphopenia and intensive care unit (ICU) admission [
13
,
14
]. Consistent with these studies, Fan et al. found that on admission, lymphopenia (
P
< .001) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (
P
< .005) were significantly associated with ICU admission [
18
]. Liu et al. suggested that COVID-19 severity could by predicted by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, low albumin, and elevated LDH and C-reactive protein (CRP) [
25
]. In a retrospective analysis of fatal and recovered cases of COVID-19, Deng et al. found that those who died had significantly lower lymphocyte count (P < .001) as well as lower lymphocyte to white blood cell ratio (P < .001) both on admission and during hospitalization compared to patients who recovered from COVID-19 [
5
]. In addition to alterations in blood cell counts, thrombotic biomarkers such as D-dimer are often elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 [
6
,
8
,
10
-
17
,
26
]. Huang et al. found that laboratory changes, such as leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increased prothrombin time, and increased D-dimer were significant predictors of ICU admission [
13
]. Han et al. observed that D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen were elevated in all patients with COVID-19, and D-dimer and FDP values were higher in patients with severe infections than those with milder disease [
17
]. Tang et al. found significantly elevated D-dimer and FDP levels, and prolonged PT and aPTT in non-survivors compared to survivors [
6
]. In some studies, D-dimer greater than 1 ug/mL (Zhou et al.,
P
= .0033) [
11
] or greater than 2.0 ug/mL (Zhang et al.,
P
< .001) on admission was predictive of in-hospital mortality [
27
]. In addition to elevations in D-dimer and neutrophilia, elevations of cytokines such as IL-1b and IL-6 also appear to be markers of severe COVID-19 [
28
]. Finally, thromboelastography and thromboelastometry parameters were also consistent with hypercoagulability in COVID-19 [
26
,
29
].

Thrombocytopenia and COVID-19

There is emerging evidence of an association between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity (
Table I
). However, there is some conflicting evidence about whether thrombocytopenia can be used as a clinical biomarker for COVID-19 and if so, whether it is associated with disease mortality. A meta-analysis of nine studies, a total of 1779 patients with COVID-19, found that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (weighted mean difference (WMD) -31 x 10
9
/L, 95% CI -35 to -29 x 10
9
/L), and that an even lower platelet count was associated with mortality (WMD -48 x 10
9
/L, 95% CI -57 to -39 x 10
9
/L) [
35
]. They reported a five-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with a low platelet count (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8-14.6) [
35
]. However, the heterogeneity of the studies included in the meta-analysis was high [
35
]. Several studies found that thrombocytopenia was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with non-severe cases [
11
-
13
]. Thrombocytopenia was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression (
P
= .015) [
30
]. There is evidence from several studies of the link between thrombocytopenia and mortality in patients with COVID-19. In studies where mortality was the primary outcome, there were notable differences in platelet count between survivors and non-survivors [
4
,
11
,
21
,
32
-
34
]. In patients with severe COVID-19, Tang et al. found that platelet count was negatively correlated with 28-day mortality [
4
]. In a multi-center retrospective cohort study by Zhou et al., the median platelet count was significantly (
P
< .0001) lower in non-survivors (165.5 x 10
9
/L, IQR 107.0-229.0) compared to survivors (220.0 x 10
9
/L, IQR 168.0-271.0) [
11
]. This was confirmed in three other retrospective studies; one of them examined 1476 patients [
32
-
34
]. Thrombocytopenia at admission was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and was associated with almost three-fold increased risk for mortality compared to those without thrombocytopenia (
P
< .05) [
32
]. While the previously mentioned studies suggest an association between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity or prognosis, other studies did not. Wang et al., found no significant difference in median platelet count between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the ICU versus non-ICU [
14
]. Similarly, Young et al. found comparable platelet counts in patients requiring supplemental oxygen versus those who did not, but no statistical comparison was performed [
19
]. Wu et al. did not find a significant difference in platelet count between survivors versus non-survivors of COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
20
]. Consistent with these studies, Fan et al. found no association between platelet count at either admission or during hospitalization and ICU admission [
18
].

Concluding remarks and recommendations

COVID-19 is rapidly spreading and infecting millions around the world [
1
]. Despite the plethora of publications, several are conflicting and many pathological aspects of this disease remain unclear. Lymphopenia has been well characterized in COVID-19 [
12
,
13
,
20
-
24
]. Other derangements in hematological tests (leukocytosis, leukopenia, neutrophilia, changes in platelet count, elevated prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), elevated aminotransaminase levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels) have been documented as well, albeit less consistently. Cytokines and acute phase reactants such as ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer have also been reported to be elevated in severe disease [
6
,
8
,
10
-
17
]. These increases in inflammatory markers imply that inflammation plays a major role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Interestingly, both decrease and increase in platelet counts have been observed with multiple mechanisms proposed [
12
,
13
,
17
,
18
,
21
,
35
]. Both types of change can indicate an enhanced inflammatory state as decreased platelet count may indicate platelet consumption from thrombi formation and increased platelet count may suggest a cytokine storm. The fact remains that SARS-CoV-2 targets lung tissue and there is some evidence that a cytokine storm or at least significant inflammation is induced [
24
,
37
]. Based on platelets' prominent role in hemostasis, inflammation, and immune defense, careful attention to changes in serial platelet counts may provide helpful insight into a patient's clinical status and disease outcomes [
51
]. COVID-19 induced thrombocytopenia appears to be mild and the bleeding manifestation remains much less frequent than thrombotic manifestations. Needless to say, there is so much that need to be uncovered about COVID-19 and additional research on this virus is in dire need. In
Table II
, we provide a summary of proposed mechanisms for changes in platelet count and our recommendations for future research.

Background and Purpose

: Patients with the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for thrombotic events and mortality. Various anticoagulation regimens are now being considered for these patients. Anticoagulation is known to increase the risk for adverse bleeding events, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most feared. We present a retrospective study of 33 patients positive for COVID-19 with neuroimaging-documented ICH and examine anticoagulation use in this population.

Methods

: Patients over the age of 18 with confirmed COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of ICH were included in this study. Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist. Electronic health records were analyzed for patient information including demographic data, medical history, hospital course, laboratory values, and medications.

Results

: We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37 to 83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small- moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL-6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Last but not least, the need for assuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

1 INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved from an epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, China
1
into a pandemic infecting more than 1 million individuals all over the world. Billions of citizens are affected by measures of social distancing and the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic. Note, SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 80% similar to SARS-CoV, and invades host human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
1
Although it is well documented that COVID-19 is primarily manifested as a respiratory tract infection, emerging data indicate that it should be regarded as a systemic disease involving multiple systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic and immune system.
2
-
4
Mortality rates of COVID-19 are lower than SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
5
; however, COVID-19 is more lethal than seasonal flu. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, but younger people without major underlying diseases may also present with potentially lethal complications such as fulminant myocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

,
7
Herein, we summarize the numerous hematologic findings and complications of COVID-19 and we provide guidance for early prevention and management of the latter.

2 RESULTS

2.1 Full blood count and biochemistry findings: correlation with prognosis

During the incubation period, usually ranging from 1 to 14 days, and during the early phase of the disease, when non-specific symptoms are present, peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte counts are normal or slightly reduced. Following viremia, SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the tissues expressing high levels of ACE2 including the lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 7 to 14 days from the onset of the initial symptoms, there is a surge in the clinical manifestations of the disease. This is with a pronounced systemic increase of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which may even be characterized as a ""cytokine storm.""
8
At this point, significant lymphopenia becomes evident. Although more in-depth research on the underlying etiology is necessary, several factors may contribute to COVID-19 associated lymphopenia. It has been shown that lymphocytes express the ACE2 receptor on their surface
9
; thus SARS-CoV-2 may directly infect those cells and ultimately lead to their lysis. Furthermore, the cytokine storm is characterized by markedly increased levels of interleukins (mostly IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interferon-g inducible protein 10, MCP-1, MIP1-a) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which may promote lymphocyte apoptosis.
10
-
12
Substantial cytokine activation may be also associated with atrophy of lymphoid organs, including the spleen, and further impairs lymphocyte turnover.
13
Coexisting lactic acid acidosis, which may be more prominent among cancer patients who are at increased risk for complications from COVID-19,
14
may also inhibit lymphocyte proliferation.
15
Table
1
presents the results of main studies regarding lymphopenia in COVID-19.

TABLE 1.
Studies and main findings for lymphocyte count in Covid-19 patients

Lymphopenia was present in 7 of 16 patients (39%). Median lymphocyte count was 1.1 (IQR: 0.8-1.7) in patients that required supplemental O
2
and 1.2 (IQR:0.8-1.6) in those that did not; no statistical comparison was undertaken.

a
P
-values calculated by Terpos et al., on the basis of contingency tables (Pearson's chi-square test) in articles that did not present formal statistical comparisons.

Guan et al. provided data on the clinical characteristics of 1099 COVID-19 cases with laboratory confirmation during the first 2 months of the epidemic in China.
16
On admission, the vast majority of patients presented with lymphocytopenia (83.2%), whereas 36.2% had thrombocytopenia, and 33.7% showed leukopenia. These hematological abnormalities were more prominent among severe vs non-severe cases (96.1% vs 80.4% for lymphocytopenia, 57.7% vs 31.6% for thrombocytopenia, and 61.1% vs 28.1% for leukopenia). These results were consistent in four other descriptive studies that were conducted during the same period in China and included 41, 99, 138 and 201 confirmed cases with COVID-19, respectively.
17
-
20
Specifically, Huang et al.,
17
and Wang et al.
19
highlighted an association between lymphopenia and need of ICU care, whereas Wu et al.
20
showed an association between lymphopenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development. Specifically, Wu et al. retrospectively analyzed possible risk factors for developing ARDS and death among 201 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
20
Increased risk of ARDS during the disease course was significantly associated with increased neutrophils (
P
< .001), decreased lymphocytes (
P
< .001) in a bivariate Cox regression analysis. Increased neutrophils (
P
= .03) were associated with increased risk of death.
20

Furthermore, lymphopenia and was also documented in approximately 40% of the first 18 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Singapore.
21
A more recent report on 69 patients confirmed the percentage of those with lymphocytopenia, whereas 20% had mild thrombocytopenia.
22
Interestingly, 69% of patients with a low lymphocyte count showed a reactive lymphocyte population including a lymphoplasmacytoid subset, which was not common in the peripheral blood of patients with SARS infection in 2003.
22
-
24
Flow cytometry did not reveal any inversion in the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio.
22
However, functional studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may impair the function of CD4+ helper and regulatory T-cells and promote the initial hyperactivation which is followed by rapid exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells.
25
,
26

In Singapore, Fan et al. also found that patients requiring ICU support had significantly lower lymphocyte levels (
P
< .001) at baseline.
22
In another retrospective study including 52 critically ill patients from Wuhan, China, lymphopenia was reported in 85% of patients.
27

Lymphopenia was also prominent among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington, USA.
28
,
29
During hospitalization, non-survivors demonstrated a more significant deterioration in lymphopenia compared with those who survived (
P
< .05).
19
It has also been reported that patients with severe disease and fatal outcomes present with a decreased lymphocyte/white blood cell ratio both in admission (
P
< .001) and during hospitalization (
P
< .001) compared with those who survived.
26
,
30
Contrary to non-survivors, survivors demonstrated a nadir of lymphocytes counted on day 7 from symptom onset and a subsequent restoration.
31
Therefore, serial assessment of lymphocyte count dynamics may be predictive of patient outcome. Tan et al have proposed a model based on lymphocyte counts at two time points; patients with less than 20% lymphocytes at days 10-12 from the onset of symptoms, and less than 5% at days 17-19 have the worst prognosis.
32

A meta-analysis of nine studies has suggested that thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with the severity of the COVID-19 disease, with very high between-studies heterogeneity though; a more sizeable drop in platelet counts was noted especially in non-survivors.
35
Table
2
shows the results of main studies examining platelet counts in COVID-19 disease.

a
P
-values calculated by Terpos et al., on the basis of contingency tables (Pearson's chi-square test) in articles that did not present formal statistical comparisons.

Interestingly, Qu et al showed that among 30 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, those presenting with a peak in the platelet count during the disease course had worse outcomes.
36
Interestingly, the platelet to lymphocyte ratio at the time of platelet peak emerged as an independent prognostic factor for prolonged hospitalization in the multivariate analysis. It was suggested that a high platelet to lymphocyte ratio may indicate a more pronounced cytokine storm, due to enhanced platelet activation.

2.2 The emerging role of biomarkers procalcitonin, ferritin and C-reactive protein in the prognosis

Table
3
summarizes the results of studies on CRP, procalcitonin and ferritin in COVID-19 disease. In the study by Guan et al.,
16
presenting results from various provinces in China, interesting biochemical findings were described; C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 60.7% of patients. Elevated procalcitonin. Which may also be suggestive of a secondary bacterial infection complicating the clinical course of COVID-19 disease, was found in 5.5%, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 41% of patients. More severe cases showed a more marked increase compared with the non-severe ones (81.5% vs 56.4% for CRP, 13.7% vs 3.7% for procalcitonin and 58.1% vs 37.2% for LDH).
16

Another emerging biomarker for COVID-19 course is interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the study by Chen et al. 52% (51/99) of patients had elevated IL-6 levels at admission.
18
Increased IL-6 levels have been associated with increased risk of death,
20
and a gradual increase during hospitalization has been reported in non-survivors.
31

2.3 Coagulation complications

Coagulation disorders are relatively frequently encountered among COVID-19 patients, especially among those with severe disease.
30
,
31
In a multicenter retrospective study during the first 2 months of the epidemic in China, 260 out of 560 patients (46.4%) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection had elevated D-dimer (>=0.5 mg/L). whereas And, the elevation was more pronounced among severe cases (59.6% vs 43.2% for non-severe ones).
16
The D-dimer dynamics can reflect the severity and their increased levels are associated with adverse outcomes among patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
38
Accordingly, elevated D-dimer (> 1.5 mg/L) was detected in 36% of patients in a descriptive study of 99 COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China.
18
Another retrospective study in China including 41 patients showed that D-dimer and prothrombin time (PT) levels were higher on admission among patients requiring ICU support (median D-dimer 2.4 mg/L for ICU vs 0.5 mg/L for non-ICU,
P
= .004; median PT 12.2 seconds for ICU vs 10.7 seconds,
P
= .012).
17
In the study by Wang et al, which was previously described, patients requiring ICU treatment had significantly higher D-dimers (
P
< .001) compared with less severe cases.
19

Patients presenting with cardiac injury in the context of COVID-19 infection are more prone to coagulation disorders compared with those without cardiac involvement (
P
= .02).
33
Patients with high troponin-T levels may present more frequently with elevated PT (
P
= .005), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (
P
= .003), and D-dimer (
P
< .001).
34
AMong 201 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, increased PT was associated with increased risk of ARDS (
P
< .001), whereas increased levels of D-dimer were significantly associated with increased risk of ARDS (
P
< .001) and death (
P
= .002).
20
The difference in median levels of D-dimer between survivors and non-survivors was larger than that between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups, which might suggest that DIC-related complications may have led a subset of patients to death independently of ARDS. In a multicenter retrospective cohort study from China, increased D-dimer levels (>1 mg/mL) were significantly associated with in-hospital death in the multivariable analysis (
P
= .003).
31
Interestingly, The D-dimer levels showed a sequential increase in time among non-survivors compared with those who survived (
P
< .05).
19
,
31
In another retrospective study by Tang et al, encompassing data from 183 consecutive patients with COVID-19, non-survivors had significantly higher D-dimer (
P
< .05), fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels (
P
< .05), and prolonged PT (
P
< .05) and APTT (
P
< .05) compared with survivors at initial evaluation. By the late hospitalization, the fibrinogen and AT levels were also significantly lower in nonsurvivors.
6
Interestingly, 71.4% of non-survivors vs 0.6% of survivors fulfilled the clinical criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during the disease course. The median time from admission to DIC manifestation was 4 days (range: 1-12 days).
6
In a prospective study evaluating the coagulation profile of patients with COVID-19; D-dimer, FDP, and fibrinogen levels were markedly higher among patients compared with healthy controls (
P
< .001 for all three comparisons). Patients with severe disease showed higher values of D-dimer and FDP than those with milder manifestation (
P
< .05 for both comparisons).
39

All the above indicate that D-dimer elevation and DIC may be common in patients with severe form of COVID-19 infection, a fact that, despite methodological limitations, became evident in a meta-analysis of four published studies (Table
4
).
40
Immune deregulation and endothelial dysfunction may be actively implicated in the underlying pathophysiology,
41
which remains to be elucidated in future studies.

The scoring system for compensated and overt DIC endorsed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis should be followed for early DIC identification.

]

The venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is an emerging issue. The rate of symptomatic VTE in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients gets as high as 10%.
43
Prolonged immobilization during illness, dehydration, an acute inflammatory state, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension, diabetes, obesity) or cardiovascular disease (ie, coronary artery disease, history of ischemic stroke or peripheral artery disease), previous history of VTE and classical genetic thrombophilia, such as heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation are common comorbidities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which potentially increase VTE risk. The possibility of endothelial cell activation/damage due to the virus binding to ACE2 receptor may further increase VTE risk. The release of a large amount of inflammatory mediators and the application of hormones and immunoglobulins in severe or critically ill patients may lead to an increased blood viscosity. Furthermore, mechanical ventilation, central venous catheterization, and surgery may induce vascular endothelial damage. The combination of all the above factors may lead to DVT occurrence or even the possibility of lethal PE due to thrombus migration. Thus, facing such VTE risk, the application of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is mandatory in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this context, VTE risk increase must be assessed in all acutely ill patients admitted to hospital, and thromboprophylaxis should be given to all these high-risk patients according to current clinical practice guidelines.
44

The use of Risk Assessment Models (RAM) such as IMPROVE-VTE in internal medicine department may be helpful. The modified IMPROVE-VTE RAM which includes the D-Dimers levels together with other clinical predictors of VTE enhances the precision of that score for the identification of high VTE risk patients eligible for an adapted pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.
45
Moreover, it is also important to pay attention to VTE risk in asymptomatic or ambulatory patients with mild COVID-19 infection. Early diagnosis of PE in COVID-19 patients with clinical manifestations of sudden deterioration of oxygenation, respiratory distress, or hypotension is of major importance for the improvement of the clinical outcomes. Although the published data are very limited, it seems reasonable that D-dimer evaluation as well as the kinetics of their increase could offer a useful information for the research of DVT and/or PE, along with the recommended imaging techniques such as ultrasound venous echo-doppler or bedside echocardiography. A recent small study in 25 PE suspected patients explored with Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA), showed that those with confirmed PE (n = 10) had D-dimer levels higher than 7000 ng/mL, compared to those without PE with significantly lower D-dimer levels.
46

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be preferred over direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) due to possible drug-drug interactions with concomitant antiviral (especially anti-HIV protease inhibitors such as ritonavir) and antibacterial (such as azithromycin) treatment.
47
Such treatments interfering with CYP3A4 and/or P-gp pathways may increase the bleeding risk or reduce the antithrombotic effect in case of DOAC use.

In a retrospective Chinese study, including 449 severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, LMWH administration among patients with markedly elevated D-dimers or in those meeting the criteria for sepsis-induced DIC was significantly associated with improved 28-day overall survival,
P
= .017 and
P
= .029 for the two patient groups, users vs non-users, respectively.
48
Furthermore, clinicians should routinely evaluate all COVID-19 patients under heparin treatment for indices of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) syndrome. This is by performing the 4 T score (thrombocytopenia, timing of platelet count fall, thrombosis or other sequalae, other causes for thrombocytopenia). Although HIT incidence in this patient group has not been determined yet, there is potentially an increased risk due to the immune deregulation and the massive inflammatory syndrome induced by the viral infection, with significant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) release.

In summary, there are four important aspects in the management of COVID-patients: (i) early diagnosis and follow-up of DIC, by applying the ISTH score (platelet count, PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, antithrombin and protein C activity monitoring) which can determine prognosis and guide more appropriate critical care support); (ii) identification of patients at high risk whatever hospitalized or ambulatory; (iii) optimization of thromboprophylaxis regimen and LMWH are the first line choice drug, and (iv) the anti-inflammatory properties of LMWH may be an added benefit in COVID 19 patients and the possible need of integrating other antithrombotic treatments such as antithrombin, and recombinant thrombomodulin that may be also helpful in this complex ""immunothrombosis"" process.

2.4 Blood and hematopoietic stem cell donation

Last but not least, it is of outmost importance to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability of blood products. Worldwide, insecurity and anxiety of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 along with measures of social isolation largely prevent blood donations.
49
Similarly, the pandemic crisis may hinder the donation of hematopoietic stem cells, as well.
50
However, the need for stem cell donors will remain constant and the need for blood donor will probably increase in order to support the critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the authorities should reformulate the infrastructure and apply all necessary safety precautions to prevent viral transmission. Effective public awareness campaigns on the importance of maintaining an adequate national blood supply, need for blood donors, and safety of the donation process should be disseminated continuously.
51
Furthermore, they should inform and educate the younger about the priceless role of blood donation and the life-saving value of hematopoietic stem cell donation. All of us should become aware of our collective responsibility and contribute to the well-being of the members of our society.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, COVID-19 disease has prominent manifestations from the hematopoietic system and is often associated with a major blood hypercoagulability. Careful evaluation of laboratory indices at baseline and during the disease course can assist clinicians in formulating a tailored treatment approach and promptly provide intensive care to those who are in greater need. Preventive measures for thromboprophylaxis and early identification of potentially lethal complications including DIC in order to effectively intervene will improve patient outcomes, and will probably reduce the death rate overall and among infected patients without significant comorbidities. Continuous vigilance is necessary and urgent studies have to be planned to define whether optimal anticoagulation regimen with or without adjunctive antithrombotic therapies (eg, LMWH, antithrombin or thrombomodulin) may be helpful in patients with COVID-19.

Since the beginning of March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than 13,000 deaths in Europe, almost 54% of which has occurred in Italy. The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance. In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets' air-dispersion and the healthcare workers' contamination. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia. It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability. However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls. It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation. Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared the SARS-CoV-2 infection-related disease (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) a pandemic. As of 26 March 2020, the WHO reported 250,592 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe with 13,950 deaths, almost 54% of which had occurred in Italy [
1
]. The dynamics of the viral diffusion in Italy, especially in the northern region of Lombardy, lead to a stressful burden on the healthcare system, particularly on the emergency departments and the intensive care units (ICU), with almost 10% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) needing invasive respiratory assistance. To avoid aqueous droplets dispersion during active disease, the use of high flow oxygen and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is generally not recommended in case of the unavailability of negative pressure isolation rooms, high level protective equipment, and adequate monitoring systems [
2
,
3
], usually currently lacking in the majority of the medical units involved in the management of COVID-19 patients during the emergency. Moreover, the application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating a viral pneumonia has been demonstrated to be unable to change the clinical course of the disease [
3
]. However, the frequent lack of ICU beds have pushed the authorities to create numerous new respiratory intermediate care units (RICU) and convert to this purpose many general internal medicine units, in order to face the increasing number of patients with severe pneumonia and ARDS-needing respiratory support and monitoring.

2. Pathology and Pathophysiology of COVID-19 Pulmonary Damage

The pathophysiological consequence of the bilateral ground glass opacities and the parenchymal consolidations, as seen in COVID-19 pneumonia, is represented by a substantial intrapulmonary shunt likely coupled with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch, especially in otherwise healthy subjects. This observation is sustained by the small increase in partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO
2
) despite delivering increasing inspired oxygen fraction (FiO
2
) percentages, as it is frequently seen in COVID-19 patients during conventional O
2
supplementation. Moreover, lung infiltrates appear to cause an ""atypical"" form of ARDS, in which an impressive shunt fraction (mean +- standard deviation; 0.50 +- 0.11) [
4
] is associated with a relatively high compliance (50.2 +- 14.3 mL/cmH
2
O) [
4
]. This event may be justified by the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction [
4
], and by a hypercoagulability state [
5
] with consequent pulmonary microvascular coagulation. Post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates, desquamation of pneumocytes, and hyaline membrane formation [
6
]. This lung tissue damage results in a severe acute HRF characterized by significant hypoxia and normal or reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO
2
).

The application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during acute HRF secondary to pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or pneumonia has been demonstrated to improve arterial oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity, shifting the tidal volume to a more compliant part of the pressure-volume curve, thus reducing both the work of breathing and the risk of tidal opening and closure of the airways [
7
]. Moreover, the application of PEEP recruits non-aerated alveoli in dependent pulmonary regions, stabilizes the airways, and reduces the inhomogeneity of lung volume distribution [
7
]. PEEP can be applied to spontaneous breathing patients in the form of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) [
8
]. CPAP is considered to be a valuable initial approach for patients suffering from acute de novo HRF and mild-moderate ARDS. In fact, non-invasive ventilation with a face mask can fail because of poor patient compliance and technical problems tied to the interface seal [
9
]. Around twenty years ago, the helmet had been proposed as an alternative to traditional interfaces. The helmet equipment, although slightly varying in some details between manufacturers, is schematically presented in
Figure S1
. Briefly, it consists in a transparent, latex free, polyvinylchloride hood joined by a metal or plastic ring to a soft polyvinylchloride collar of different sizes [
10
]. Two underarm straps are attached to the ring which keeps it from flying upwards when the gas flow pressurizes it [
10
]. The average volume of the hood ranges from 12 to 15 L with the patient's head in place. The high flow gas enters the hood from one side, while on the opposite side, an expiratory port with an integrated manometer and an adjustable or fixed PEEP valve are applied (
Figure S1
). The anti-suffocation valve is applied on the hood's surface and fixed by means of a screw shaped mechanism for rapid access to the inner part of the helmet (
Figure S1
).

Physiological studies demonstrated that the helmet and the face mask performed equally in reducing the inspiratory work of breathing during continuous high flow CPAP [
10
]. The non-invasive application of CPAP with the helmet significantly improved arterial oxygenation compared with standard oxygen therapy in patients with community acquired pneumonia [
11
]. Moreover, the helmet CPAP applied in patients with severe HRF due to pneumonia demonstrated to reduce the risk of meeting the criteria for endotracheal intubation compared with the Venturi mask [
12
]. Some data also suggest that the helmet CPAP decreased the incidence of endotracheal intubation in patients with severe acute HRF after abdominal surgery and in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancy [
13
,
14
].

In a recent overview of the indications for the protection of healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, Ferioli and coworkers showed how the helmets provided with a tight air cushion around the neck-helmet interface, in a double limb circuit, have negligible air dispersion during NIV application [
15
], and represent, together with the CPAP via oronasal mask, the ventilatory support that allows the minimum room air contamination [
15
]. In the current restricted availability of negative pressure rooms, we suggest applying an anti-viral filter both on the inspiratory and on the expiratory ports of the helmet (
Figure S1
). This should maximally reduce the risk of droplets dispersion. It should be noted that in case of sneezing or coughing, the helmet appears to be more practical and comfortable compared with conventional oronasal masks.

The helmet is generally more tolerated compared with the face mask, especially if CPAP therapy must be extended for several days, as it increases the comfort for the patients, reduces the risk of facial decubitus, allows patients to be fed and hydrated orally, and therapy to be administered without removing the helmet [
10
,
16
,
17
,
18
]. Finally, the helmet only needs an access to a high flow oxygen source (or a combination of compressed air and oxygen) without necessitating electricity.

4. CPAP Side Effects and Helmet Pitfalls

The administration of CPAP is not free from pitfalls. As it may cause over-distention of normal alveolar spaces causing barotrauma, it may also increase physiological dead space and reduce tissue perfusion [
7
]. Moreover, excessive PEEP may have detrimental effects on neuro-diaphragmatic coupling [
19
] and cardiac output, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular function [
7
]. Finally, PEEP is often used to offset hyperinflation and intrinsic PEEP in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) during NIMV, but the prevalence of chronic pulmonary comorbidities in COVID-19 patients reported in literature so far was low (e.g., COPD ranging from 1.1% [
20
] to 10% [
21
]), leaving the need for NIV to a limited number of patients [
18
].

Compared with the face mask, the helmet, due to its larger internal volume, might facilitate CO
2
rebreathing [
22
]. The inspired CO
2
concentration was found to be constantly higher when CPAP was delivered by means of a continuous flow CPAP helmet (for flows ranging from 20 to 60 L and PEEP from 0 to 15 cmH
2
O) than with a face mask (mean +- standard deviation; 3.1 +- 0.15 versus 0.8 +- 0.3 mmHg,
p
< 0.01) [
18
]. This was also true when the helmet was tested during pressure support ventilation [
23
]. However, for CPAP delivery, higher flow rates corresponded lower inspired concentrations of CO
2
[
18
]. The CO
2
rebreathing depends primarily on two factors: (a) the fresh gas passing through the helmet, and (b) the amount of CO
2
produced by the patient [
22
,
24
]. The presence of an antisuffocation valve (
Figure S1
) limits the CO
2
rebreathing, but cannot prevent the loss of PEEP in case of gas flow interruption [
22
]. In this case, the adoption of larger valves allows for a lower CO
2
rebreathing, but also a higher reduction in FiO
2
[
25
]. When CPAP is administered by means of mechanical ventilators, it is generally not advisable to use the helmet [
8
,
22
] because the higher compliance of the helmet may cause a delay between the delivered inspiratory flow and patients' inspiratory effort, which can cause patient-ventilatory asynchrony. Moreover, the mixing between the inspired and expired flows predisposes to CO
2
rebreathing [
8
]. The most effective CPAP is achieved when the PEEP level is maintained throughout the respiratory cycle, with inspiratory fluctuations in PEEP reflecting an insufficient gas delivery compared with the patient minute ventilation [
10
]. This is why high flow systems should be preferred when administering CPAP with the helmet.

Taking into account the aforementioned limitations, especially the accidental gas flow interruption with a subsequent possible dangerous risk in PEEP and oxygen reduction, we underline that the application of the helmet CPAP should be always supported by appropriate and dedicated monitoring and alarming systems.

5. A Management Algorithm for COVID-19 Patients with De Novo Respiratory Failure

Helmet CPAP is currently being extensively used in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the relative simplicity of setting up a CPAP helmet, the need for attentive and careful monitoring of the respiratory and hemodynamic response to the application of PEEP should be part of the standard operating procedures of the unit. Based on the observation and care provided so far to more than 70 COVID-19 patients with HRF in our RICU, we propose that the initiation of the CPAP treatment should always depend upon the PaO
2
/FiO
2
ratio rather than on peripheral O
2
saturation (SpO
2
) or the respiratory rate (RR), as falsely high SpO
2
and low RR may be often secondary to the frequent mixed or metabolic alkalosis experienced by COVID-19 patients due to dehydration, iatrogenic diarrhea, and hypoalbuminemia [
21
,
26
]. In fact, an increase of pH value causes a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, while hypocapnia makes the alveolar ventilation-PaO
2
relationship much steeper only at values of PaO
2
much lower than those usually considered as the cutoff for respiratory failure [
26
]. In addition, in the early phases of a progressive HRF, especially in case of otherwise healthy young subjects, the respiratory rate might be a less reliable sign of hypoxia due to the ability of these subjects to increase the minute ventilation by increasing the tidal volume before showing signs of respiratory distress [
27
]. Therefore, arterial blood gas analysis should be used as the main monitoring tool for establishing the need for CPAP and its titration. Initiating CPAP with pressures as low as 5 cmH
2
O should allow to control and adjust for potential cardiovascular and pulmonary side effects (
Figure 1
). In our opinion, PEEP should not exceed 12-13 cmH
2
O in order to avoid barotrauma, self-induced lung injury, tension pneumothorax, and negative effects on hemodynamics [
7
]. Moreover, it has been suggested that COVID-19 pulmonary infiltrates are associated with poor recruitability, thus high PEEP should be avoided to preserve patients from severe hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention [
4
]. Coppola and coworkers [
28
] have recently demonstrated that in patients with ARDS undergoing lung protective ventilation, the amount of intrinsic PEEP is negligible. If present, intrinsic PEEP did not change the total airway resistance, compliance of the respiratory system, and lung recruitability [
28
]. This observation, along with the aforementioned PEEP side effects [
7
], sustains the hypothesis that higher levels of PEEP (e.g., >15 cmH
2
O) during non-invasive CPAP application and without the continuous monitoring of lung mechanics available only in the ICU should be avoided.

Currently, to our knowledge, there are no shared recommendations on weaning from CPAP in adults with HRF and severe pneumonia [
29
], and so far, the majority of evidence on this topic comes from pediatric/neonatal studies [
30
]. We propose that, as the patient reaches clinical and respiratory stability, the weaning from the helmet should start from reducing the PEEP to the lower possible value (for the helmet, usually 5-6 cmH
2
O) maintaining a FiO
2
not higher than 50%. If lung derecruitment is absent and the P/F ratio is stable as compared with higher PEEP values (
Figure 1
), the patient is ready to undergo a CPAP weaning trial. A weaning trial should be attempted every day to avoid a delay in CPAP removal.

We are aware that the latter approach is based on clinical observation and not on data from randomized clinical trials, but we believe that this procedure may reduce the number of patients that fail weaning from CPAP and expedite the course of hospitalization.

During the writing of the present manuscript, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has released new guidelines for the management of critically ill adults with COVID-19 [
31
]. The authors recommend the use of high flow oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation if high flow oxygen is unavailable or ineffective in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure [
31
]. Surprisingly, the application of CPAP is not mentioned [
31
]. Due to the pathophysiology of the acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, we believe that an approach based on non-invasive ventilation, unless hypercapnia is present, could be avoided. Considering also the poor availability of negative pressure rooms in the majority of hospitals involved in the current pandemic, and the need for preserving the healthcare personnel from viral contamination, an approach based on non-invasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy should be left only to specific and protected settings [
15
,
32
]. In
Table S1
, we present preliminary data about in hospital mortality of patients treated in our RICU, compared with data available in literature so far. Although care settings and populations are inhomogeneous, in the majority of cases, the ARDS severity and mortality of patients treated with the helmet CPAP is comparable to ICU cohorts (
Table S1
).

6. Conclusions

The complexity of the clinical picture in patients with COVID-19 related HRF deserves great attention in the identification of patients with high risk of rapid respiratory function deterioration. The application of CPAP with the helmet can represent a valid pulmonary support in the adequate setting and with simple monitoring tools. A careful CPAP titration can optimize the recruitment of unventilated lung regions and improve hypoxemia, making it a suitable bridge to ICU or a supportive treatment to improve patients' outcomes. A better tolerability of the helmet and a reduced room contamination compared with oronasal masks may also improve patients' clinical management, increasing the safety of the healthcare workers involved in the assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new kind of coronavirus, the SARS-Cov2, started the biggest pandemic of the century. It has already killed more than 250,000 people. Because of this, it is necessary quick and precise diagnosis test. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results takes too long to be available. Tests base on IgM/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% +- 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 +- 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 +- 0.007, precision of 0.938 +- 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 +- 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost. The desktop version of the system is fully functional and available for free use.

I. INITIAL WORK UP IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH COVID-19
A. Patient screens positive based on complaint of fever (subjective/objective) or upper/lower
respiratory symptoms at triage and is directly bedded in a private room. Some patients may present
with anosmia or GI symptoms such as diarrhea. Also, consider lethargy or generalized weakness as
a possible presenting complaint in the elderly population.
a. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms and without comorbid conditions are
directed for expedited evaluation in the Bio-Containment Unit. Screening, evaluation
and treatment can take place there without comingling this patient population with the
non-infected and more seriously ill populations.
b. Please assume that all undifferentiated resuscitations and all cardiac arrest cases
BIBEMS are positive screens and wear full PPE in the management of these patients.
c. Intubation PPE packs are standard across the hospital and are to be used if you are
intubating a patient
i. Triage nurse obtains patient's cell phone number and e-mail and places the
number in the triage note and directly beds the patient in a private room -
preferably negative pressure if one is available.
ii. AN ISOLATION ORDER (Respiratory and Contact Isolation - Reason: COVID 19
R/O) MUST BE PLACED IN THE EHR. THIS CAN BE COMPLETED BY THE NURSE
OR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN.
B. Provider history is obtained using a SpectraLink phone and via calling the patient on their cell phone.
C. At this point, any provider working in the ED can evaluate a patient that has a positive triage screen
provided that they have participated in proper donning and doffing training and are wearing
appropriate PPE during the entire patient interaction.
D. For patients that are acutely ill, deemed highly likely to require admission to an acute care facility,
the following tests should be ordered by the ED team:
Laboratory and Diagnostics
 CBC with differential  Pregnancy test  PORTABLE CXR
 CMP  LDH  ECG
 Lactic acid  Ferritin
 CPK  ABG
 CRP  Urinalysis
 PT/INR/PTT  Urine culture
E. Aligning the clinical evaluation with the patient's prior and present Advance Care Planning
document(s) such as Advance Directives and/or POLST form is essential; recommend to review
documents in EPIC/medical chart
F. If the work-up does not reveal a focal source or has findings suggestive of COVID-19, then a COVID-
19 PCR Test may be ordered.
a. Bacterial co-infection thus far seems uncommon, but vigilance should be maintained
b. Viral co-infection is thought to be rare but co-infections have been reported with other
respiratory viruses
c. An RPP is no longer suggested for patients with suspected COVID-19, please reserve for
special circumstances
G. Non-Contrast Chest CT in the ED as a COVID screening test is CONTRAINDICATED.
2
a. There is no current role in the US for routine use of Chest CT as a screening test in ED
patients
b. Sensitivity and Specificity range from 60 to 90%
c. The risk of cross contamination of patients and infection of staff has universally (UCSF,
Emory, University of Washington, etc.) been considered a risk that outweighs any
marginal benefit
H. Blood Cultures
Due to the low incidence of bacterial co-infection in patients presenting with COVID-19 infection,
the following strategy is recommended to avert unnecessary testing and further focus antimicrobial
treatment.
Recommendations are broken into 3 categories:
1. High Suspicion COVID-19 infection Blood cultures are NOT recommended
2. Low Suspicion COVID-19 infection Draw 1 set of blood cultures
COVID-19 in the differential as a rule out
3. Presentation consistent with: Draw 2 sets of blood cultures
 Critical illness
 Immunosuppression
 High Suspicion due to
signs/symptoms consistent with
bacterial infection
I. Additional General Pearls
a. Aerosolization:
i. Nebulizers (with the exception of intubated patients with closed circuit
ventilation), high flow oxygen, and NIPPV are contraindicated in COVID-19
patients due to the high risk of aerosolization of infectious particles. Non-
rebreather Face mask and nasal cannula are both acceptable.
ii. Respiratory metered dose inhalers are the preferred delivery system for non-
intubated patients.
iii. If using high flow oxygen, a surgical mask should be placed on the patient which
may reduce the risk of aerosolization.
b. Attending physicians: If you have any patient whom you think may be a clinical trial
candidate, please call 551-996-2994 (research hotline number)

vii. Elevated CRP (61-86%)
viii. Elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%)
ix. Prolonged prothrombin time (58%)
x. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (40%)
xi. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (34%)
b. Chest radiographs are characterized by bilateral peripheral patchy infiltrates and chest CT scans
demonstrate ground-glass infiltrates.
i. Infiltrates with pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are usually not associated with
COVID-19 infections.
c. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.
d. Just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5-13
days).
e. ARDS developed in 17-29% of hospitalized patients; median time from symptom onset to ARDS
was 8 days.
f. Approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required
intensive care for respiratory support.
g. 11-64% received high-flow oxygen therapy and 47-71% received mechanical ventilation; some
hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and
mechanical ventilation (4-42%).
B. Goals of Care
a. To provide patient-centered supportive care with attention to individual's goals of care.
b. To identify patient's Advance Directive and/or POLST forms.
c. To identify early on patients who require higher level of care, (i.e early intubation)
d. To identify patients who are on route to recovery and are safe to be discharged.
e. To manage comorbidities
f. To maintain stewardship, given limited resources
C. Infection Prevention
a. Work closely with Infection Prevention to properly isolate all patients under investigation.
b. CDC guidelines denote contact and droplet precautions with a faceshield for any COVID-19
positive or PUI patient not undergoing an aerosol generating procedure.
c. For patients undergoing any aerosol generating procedure, an airborne isolation room with
negative pressure is recommended with use of N95 masks and face shields in addition to
contact precautions. Examples of these procedures include intubation, open airway suctioning,
4
sputum induction, bronchoscopy, etc. Also included are ventilated patients undergoing changes
in the ventilator circuit or filter changes.
d. Viral testing is becoming more readily available with faster turnaround times, allowing better
conservation of isolation beds.
e. Ensure all staff undergo refresher training by infection control for proper donning and doffing of
PPE.
f. Strongly consider cohorting COVID-19 and high risk cases to one location.
i. Link to HMH Recommendations for Isolation Rooms:
https://hmhmaestro.org/wp-content/uploads/COVID-Room-Placement-03-15-0-

recommend proactive testing
 Non-critical care patients: contin Application of appropriate skin
protections uous telemetry monitoring, daily Troponin, BNP q3d, and
limited echo q3d for function and effusion
 Critical care patients: continuous telemetry monitoring, daily Troponin, BNP
q3d, and a daily limited echo for function and effusion
 If any patient develops frequent PVCs, arrhythmia, hypotension, or signs of
circulatory collapse, STAT Echo will be performed
F. Palliative Care Considerations
a. Consider placing Palliative Care consult in EPIC for goals of care discussion and/or symptoms
related to end of life care (EOLC). If implementing EOLC, use EOLC order set in EPIC and
consider compassionate extubation or ventilator de-esculation. [Note: endotracheal tube
will remain in place and ventilator circuit will remain intact until the patient has died. This
may reduce risk of exposure of Covid-19 to vistors and bedside staff]

b. For clinical guidance: management of symptoms commonly encountered in patients with
serious illness and COVID-19: https://hmhmaestro.org/wp-content/uploads/symptom-
management-guidelines.pdf
c. For clinical guidance: difficult conversations during the COVID-19 era
https://hmhmaestro.org/wp-content/uploads/Difficult-Conversations-Guidance-04-27-
20.pdf
G. Respiratory Considerations
a. Bronchodilators as needed: Avoid unnecessary usage
i. MDI preferred in non-ventilated patients. To conserve supply, reserve for patients
with active wheezing.
ii. If giving to a patient on a ventilator, a one way valve must be utilized for nebulized
treatments via the vent circuit to avoid aerosolization into the surrounding
environment
b. Conservative fluid management
c. Oxygen supplementation
i. Nasal cannula and Facemask O2 as needed
ii. Increase FiO2 as needed and favor 100% non-rebreather over Hi-Flow.
iii. Hi-Flow can be used but use with caution given potential concerns for aerosolization
of the virus. Recommend to place surgical mask on patient over Hi Flow to minimize
aerosolization.
d. Avoid BiPAP/CPAP. Associated with high treatment failure rates and increased risk of
aerosolization of the virus
i. If BiPAP/CPAP used, must use filter on expiratory limb.
e. Recommend early intubation for rapidly progressive disease or with severe comorbidities
i. Patients with COVID-19 may desaturate quickly
f. Consider proning in non-intubated patients with severe hypoxemia (See below for
Guideline for Proning for Non-Intubated Adult Patients with ARDS)
g. Intubation procedure: Should be done by a senior, experienced operator.
i. Intubation should ideally be done with RSI, without BVM, and with one pass.
ii. Pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO2 for 3-5 minutes
iii. Avoid BVM. If BVM needed to oxygenate, must use BVM filter attachment.
iv. Preferred use of video laryngoscopy
v. Controlled suctioning
h. If intubated, follow ARDSNET protocol to ventilate with low tidal volumes and appropriate
PEEP, however the protocol must be adjusted if using prone positioning.
i. Key points
i. This COVID ARDS patient population has been found to have a dramatic positive
response to prone positioning, with significant improvements in PO2.
ii. Upon supination, however, the response is often quickly reversed
iii. Consider early use of prone positioning
iv. Adjustments of PEEP should only be made while in supine position to prevent
severe hypoxemic events upon changing from prone to supine.
1. Link to Policy: ""Prone Positioning for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS) P-15"" [PolicyStat ID: 4406686]
2. Please refer to Epic order set: ""Novel Corona Virus -19 Prone Position Order
Set For Critically ill Patients.""
v. Avoid disconnecting from the ventilator
8
vi. Closed suctioning system
j. Manage septic shock according to local guidelines while maintaining standards of care
k. Consider ECMO for refractory cases (See ECMO guidelines below)
H. Treatment Recommendations
General Treatment Guidance
 There is currently no evidence from RCTs to recommend any specific treatment for patients with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Treatment should be considered in symptomatic
patients requiring hospitalization based on a careful assessment of risk factors. The majority of
treatment is supportive care with prevention of spread of the disease.
 The decision to initiate treatment outside of a clinical trial should be based on a risk assessment
including clinical status, co-morbid conditions, acuity of illness, and concomitant medications
EMPIRIC ANTIBIOTICS
Due to the difficulty in differentiating bacterial vs viral pneumonia at the time of presentation, it may be
appropriate to initiate an empiric antimicrobial regimen based on the clinical diagnosis (CAP, HCAP, or
septic shock). Due to the low incidence of bacterial co-infection, consider discontinuation of antibiotics
upon return of a positive COVID-19 PCR. If targeting CAP organisms:
 Mild to moderate pneumonia: Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q24h plus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 5-7 d
 Severe pneumonia (critically ill): Ceftriaxone 2 gram IV q24h plus azithromycin 500mg IV daily for 5-7 d
ANTICOAGULATION
 The underlying coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 remains to be full elucidated, patients
admitted to the hospital with the disease appear to hypercoagulable. Additionally, some patients with
severe disease may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with fulminant activation
of coagulation, microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors.
VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized patient
 VTE prophylaxis is indicated for all patients with COVID-19 infection unless a contraindication is
present (active bleeding or platelet count < 25 x 103 /L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L)
 Low molecular weight heparin is preferred over unfractionated heparin if CrCl > 30 mL/min to
minimize entry into patient room
 For patients with ESRD or AKI requiring renal replacement therapy, prophylaxis with unfractionated
heparin is preferred
 Sequential compression devices are recommended if pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated
1. Prophylactic Dosing Recommendations (NON-Critically Ill Patients)
Recommended Obesity*
Medication CrCl < 30 mL/min
Dosing (>100 kg or BMI >40 kg/m2)
Enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily 40 mg SQ twice daily 30 mg SQ daily
Unfractionated
5000 units SQ q8h 7500 units SQ q8h No adjustment
heparin
2. Prophylactic Dosing Recommendations for Critically-Ill Patients at High Thrombotic Risk
9
Recommended Obesity*
Medication CrCl < 30 mL/min
Dosing (>100 kg or BMI >40 kg/m2)
Enoxaparin 40 mg SQ q12h 0.5 mg/kg SQ q12h 40 mg SQ daily
Unfractionated
7500 units SQ q8h Utilize enoxaparin No adjustment
heparin
Increased prophylactic doses in critically ill patients have been suggested by some clinicians due to an
increased perceived thrombotic risk despite standard dose prophylaxis. In a recently published study of
184 critically ill COVID patients, despite receiving standard pharmacologic prophylaxis, 31 experienced
thrombotic events (25 PEs, 3 other venous thrombotic events, 3 arterial thrombotic events)
* Obesity may be overrepresented in the COVID-19 population (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047415).
While increasing prophylactic dosing in obese patients remains controversial due to conflicting data, given the
high prevalence of large body habitus in this disease and the observation that VTE risk may be increased, the
suggested dosing is above.
Therapeutic Anticoagulation
 D-dimer is a major breakdown product of fibrin and is often non-specifically elevated various
inflammatory processes. Early data from China has identified elevated D-dimer levels to be associated
with mortality in COVID-19 disease. An elevated D-dimer is not an absolute indication for
anticoagulation.
 Both the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) and the American Society of
Hematology (ASH) have suggested utilizing D-dimer (in addition to other markers of DIC) as a
prognostication tool to guide level of care. In the setting of elevated D-dimer (> 3 mcg/mL), trending
of and close monitoring of D-dimer, platelet count, PT/aPTT and fibrinogen is recommended.
 If a D-dimer is markedly elevated (>10mcg/mL), consider evaluation with Venous dopplers and a
cardiac echo (to look for right heart strain).
o Consider full anticoagulation pending the results if clinical suspicion warrants.
o If Dopplers are positive or echo is suggestive of acute right heart strain due to a pulmonary
embolus, continue therapeutic anticoagulation.
o If Dopplers are negative, and there is no evidence of new right heart strain on the echo, we
advocate trending the D-dimer. If the D-dimer is decreasing significantly, resume prophylactic
anticoagulation
 Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation if VTE is detected. Empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in the
setting of significantly elevated D-dimer has been suggested by some clinicians but has not currently
been evaluated. Empiric anticoagulation for COVID-19 is presently discouraged by the ISTH and the
ASH
POST DISCHARGE ANTICOAGULATION
Post Discharge treatment for new or established thrombotic disease:
* DOACs should be considered as first-line therapy in appropriate patients, to minimize the need
for frequent laboratory monitoring and clinic visits. LMWH may be considered in select cases (e.g.
DOAC is not approved by insurance), however the need for subcutaneous injections may limit its
feasibility for long term use. In general, warfarin should be avoided to limit contact of patients
with healthcare services required for INR monitoring.
* In patients with VTE receiving hemodialysis, apixaban may be a reasonable option. In several
retrospective studies, apixaban was shown to be effective without conferring an increased risk of
bleeding in this patient population.
10
* Contraindications to DOACs include mechanical heart valves, valvular AF, pregnancy or
breastfeeding, APLS, and co-administration of medications including strong CYP3A and P-
glycoprotein inhibitors (-azole medications, HIV protease inhibitors [dependent on DOAC, may
just require dose reduction], CYP3A4 inducers (antiepileptics), St. John's Wort, rifampin, etc.
* Current guidelines recommend patients with provoked PE/DVT be treated for a duration of 3
months.
Post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in the absence of confirmed thrombotic disease:
* The incidence of VTE post-discharge in COVID-19 patients is unknown, however these patients
appear to be at higher risk than the general population. Consideration to continue post-discharge
prophylaxis should be given to patients who are deemed high-risk. High-risk groups in the non-
COVID-19 context that have previously been considered for extended thromboprophylaxis after
hospital discharge include reduced mobility, advanced age, comorbidities such as active cancer,
and elevated D-dimers. D-dimer should be one of the factors considered for initiating post-
discharge thromboprophylaxis, but decisions should not be made based on this value alone.
* Extended prophylaxis using a regimen of rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (or apixaban 2.5 mg Q12H for
patients with CrCl <30mL/min) may reduce the risk of VTE, at the cost of an increase in bleeding
events, including major bleeding. The rationale for recommending apixaban in the setting of renal
impairment is due to an increased risk of bleeding observed with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily in this
patient population.
* In patients that don't meet criteria for high thrombotic risk based on above or have unacceptable
bleeding risk, low dose aspirin can be considered as an alternative antithrombotic agent.
* The recommended duration of prophylaxis with these agents is unclear, but should be at least 7
days but not exceed 30 days.
Should empiric therapeutic anticoagulation be continued post-discharge in patients without a
diagnosis of VTE due to inability to undergo diagnostic imaging?
 There is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend therapeutic anticoagulation post-
discharge in patients without confirmed VTE.
 For patients in whom therapeutic anticoagulation is discontinued at discharge, please refer to the
previous section, 'Post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in the absence of confirmed thrombotic
disease' for further recommendations.
 If therapeutic anticoagulation is continued due to high suspicion or high risk of PE/DVT, repeat
imaging (CT chest or duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities) should be performed within 30
days, once the patient is considered negative for COVID-19.
STATINS
 Patients on guideline-directed statin therapy should be continued
 Patients who are not on statins but have a guideline indication for a statin (e.g. history of MI, CAD,
etc), if no contraindication, consider starting:
o Atorvastatin 40 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily (high-intensity statins)
o When major drug-drug interactions with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are expected, pravastatin
80 mg daily should be considered
 Currently there is no outcome data that supports the use of statins in patients with COVID-19
infection outside of guideline indications
11
 Caution: elevated liver enzymes may preclude inclusion in clinical trial (avoid statins if AST/ALT >3x
upper limit of normal)
Rationale:
o Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are major risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and
mortality. The case-fatality rates with COVID-19 infection are 10.8% in patients with established
CVD and 7.3% with diabetes
o Statins may also help promote antiviral innate immune response
STEROIDS
Recommended Criteria for Use:
 Moderate to severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation or 100% High Flow Nasal Canula (PF ratio<200)
 Avoid the use of corticosteroids in early phases of illness due to theoretical concern of increased viral
shedding
Rationale for Corticosteroids: Data surrounding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 is
conflicting. Current guidance from WHO and CDC advises against the use of corticosteroids based on data
extrapolated from other viral infections such as MERS, influenza and SARS. Surviving Sepsis Campaign
guidelines recommends to consider smaller doses for short courses to inhibit cytokine cascade and to
prevent disease progression, particularly in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PF ratio 200). The use
of corticosteroids in other populations (e.g community acquired pneumonia, early ARDS) suggest
improved mortality and reduced time on mechanical ventilation. The generalizability of these studies to
COVID-19 patients should be done with caution due to methodological limitations and selection bias. The
most recent evidence recommends to consider steroids based on the premise that generation of cytokine
storm can lead to ARDS, which is the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients.
Suggested Dosing Regimen: Methylprednisone 1-2 mg/kg IV daily for 5 - 7 days
IL-6 ANTAGONIST
Based on site availability, please consider enrollment into an IL-6 antagonist clinical trial prior to
evaluation for off-label use of tocilizumab
The following criteria have been revised to identify patients that may benefit from IL-6 inhibition with
tocilizumab based on preliminary observational data:
Patient must meet the following criteria:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome on mechanical ventilation or worsening oxygenation (despite
corticosteroids) with high oxygen requirements (80-100%) on High Flow Nasal Cannula or 15 L Non-
Rebreather Mask
2. Course of illness is greater than 7 days from onset of symptoms
3. Informed Consent documented in the medical record
Exclusion for tocilizumab:
 Known active tuberculosis (TB), history of incompletely treated TB, suspected or known
extrapulmonary TB, suspected or known systemic bacterial or fungal infections
 Presence of any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) less than 2000 mm3, AST/ALT greater than 5 x upper limit of normal, platelets < 50,000
 Presence of multi-organ system failure in a critically ill patient
Adult Dosing Regimen:
4 mg/kg - 8 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes x 1 dose (Max Dose 800 MG)

TREATMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECOMMENDED AT THIS TIME
 Hydroxychloroquine: There is insufficient clinical data to support the role of hydroxychloroquine
in treatment of COVID-19. The evidence that has been accrued thus far does not suggest a clear
benefit, and may be suggestive of potential harm in both hospitalized patients and outpatients.
NEW RECOMMENDATION: The routine use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19
CANNOT be recommended at this time. The results of ongoing clinical trials will further define a
role, if any, before the decision is made to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to a hospitalized patient.
14
 Azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine has received much attention in the recent
media. The release of unpublished reports and public opinion has significantly influenced the demand
for this regimen. The data continues to be too limited to make a recommendation for this
combination for the treatment of COVID-19 when evaluated in the context of a risk vs potential
benefit scenario. Due to the lack of documented clinical outcomes and the risk of potential harm (e.g.
additive QTc prolongation), at this time it is not recommended to use azithromycin as monotherapy
or to it in combination with hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19. We will continue to
evaluate new information as it becomes available
 Lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra(r)) is no longer recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 based on a
recently published clinical trial conducted in China (3/18/2020 NEJM) demonstrating no benefit over
the standard of care in 199 patients infected with SARS CoV-2
 Vitamin C: Currently, there is no published literature demonstrating a clinical benefit to advocate for
the use of vitamin C against SARS CoV2. The interest for use with COVID-19 comes from a suggested
benefit in other viral infections based on the premise that vitamin C serum levels are reduced in the
setting of acute infectious diseases and that there may be some immunomodulating effects that
would be beneficial with viral infections. In repeated meta-analyses, vitamin C has not demonstrated
a reduction in the incidence of the common cold. A reduction in the duration of colds was
demonstrated in some trials, however could not be replicated in subsequent trials. Despite the
biological plausibility that vitamin C may be beneficial for the treatment of viral infections, there is
limited evidence to support a recommendation at this time. We will continue to evaluate new
information as it becomes available
 Other therapies: Therapies with insufficient evidence for treatment of COVID-19: oseltamivir,
baloxavir, interferon, ribavirin, IVIG, zinc. As evidence emerges, status will be updated.
H. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
Currently there are no recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis with medications
I. Nutrition Support Recommendations
a. Timing
i. Initiate enteral support within 24 to 36 hours of admission.
ii. Hold in those with high pressure respiratory support and/or increasing pressor
requirements, need for multiple agents, MAP trends consistently <60, rising lactate trends,
combined with enteral feeding intolerance (EFI): Ileus, abdominal distention, vomiting.
iii. Consider parenteral nutrition (PN) in those patients who meet criteria for moderate or
severe malnutrition meeting < 50% nutritional needs > 10 to 14 days. PN subverts concern
for ischemic bowel, reduces droplet transmission and enteral related
procedures/maintenance.
b. Delivery
i. Cluster enteral care such as bolus times and water flushes when in room for other care.
ii. Initiate feeding with high protein (>20%), polymeric, isosmotic formula (PROMOTE).
Advance to fiber containing formula (JEVITY) once stable with bowel regularity. Anecdotal
reports see increased success and nutrient delivery using Peptamen 1.5 or similar product
(calorically dense, hydrolyzed whey protein, improved gastric emptying).
iii. 24 hour continuous infusion preferred (as feeding pump availability permits).
iv. Low dose, hypocaloric/trophic advancing to at least 70-80% caloric goal over 1st week.
15
a. 15-20 kcal/kg actual weight (10/kg obesity/morbid obesity).
b. >1.2 g protein/kg protein, actual weight (caution excessive dosing in obesity).
v. Bolus administration when indicated: Peptamen 1.5, 125 mL (Prone) / 250 mL (Supine) 3-4
times daily or when nurse in room for other care.
vi. Evaluate indication for prokinetic agents with bowel dysmotility.
c. Monitoring
i. Formula and volume goal adjustments per fevers, dehydration, hypernatremia, AKI, steroid
induced hyperglycemia, pressor/sedation/paralytic requirements, GI dysmotility.
ii. EFI: abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, distention, increased gastric outputs >250 mL q6h.
d. Considerations for non-intubated, hypoxic patient with or without need for prone therapy
i. Encourage smaller meals, nutrient dense snacks and calorically dense oral nutrition
supplements when patient is supine (Ensure Plus, Ensure Enlive, Nepro for >350-420
calories, > 13 to 20 g protein per 240 mL serving).
ii. Hold trays or downgrade to NPO if patient displays increased work of breathing with oral
intake and/or requires increased oxygen requirements.
III. ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES
A. HUMC Guidelines for Radiologic Imaging in Patients with COVID-19
 Guidelines for Portable Radiography
 To the greatest extent possible, indications for portable radiography should be examined
critically, due to potential downstream impact on patient and team member safety, and overall
PPE utilization. Indications such as ""COVID-19"" and ""respiratory insufficiency"" should be re-
evaluated, and imaging should be reserved for cases where clinical status has changed or
interpretation would alter management.
 Strong consideration should be given to bundling procedures (i.e. intubation, line placement,
etc) into a single encounter, thereby limiting post-procedural radiography.
 Extraneous hardware and material should be removed from the patient room prior to arrival of
the radiology team to maximize efficiency, ensure appropriate patient positioning, and improve
diagnostic value of the examination.
 Guidelines for Evaluation and Treatment of Ultrasound Requests
 Ultrasonography is a very hands-on modality in which our ultrasound technologists are at a
higher risk of exposure. We ask that all requests for sonography on all inpatients regardless of
COVID-19 status (non-Covid, Covid-19 positive or PUI) be requested after careful consideration
about necessity, whether it would answer the chief complaint or change patient management.
 As a measure to maintain appropriateness and minimize ultrasound technologist exposure, a
Radiologist will triage and approve all requests for sonography in collaboration with the ordering
physician. A Radiologist is available 24/7 to review the clinical indication and discuss the case.
 Portable/Bedside sonography can be performed for this subset of patients during daytime hours
8am-5pm. If there are extenuating circumstances that would require off-hours portable/bedside
sonography, these can also be triaged on a case-by case
General Guidelines
16
1. All Oncology and stat outpatient requests for sonography will be scheduled and performed
in the Mediplex Suite 112.
2. CAS inpatients will be scanned as portables using the Mediplex Ultrasound machine.
3. Only emergent exams will be performed on the overnight shift.
4. Two ultrasound machines will be dedicated to COVID-19 positive and PUI patients.
5. Ultrasound machines will be draped in plastic for all COVID-19 positive and PUI patient's
scans.
6. All Ultrasound Interventional procedures will continue to be done in the main Ultrasound
Department
 Guidelines for Performing Exams on COVID-19 Positive and PUI Patients
 The Chief/Lead Ultrasound Technologist will review all COVID-19 positive and PUI patient orders
with the attending Ultrasound Radiologist and facilitate communication between the referring
physician and the Radiologist reviewing the request.
 Abbreviated exams will be performed.
 This procedure will be followed on all shifts.
 All COVID-19 positive and PUI patients will be done as portable.
 N95 respirators should be worn by all team members in the Ultrasound Department for the
duration of their shift following the below guideline for extended use as followed by the
Emergency Department.
 Ultrasound technologist will follow appropriate donning and doffing of Personal Protective
Equipment per HUMC protocol while performing exams on All COVID-19 positive and PUI
patients.
 Two Ultrasound technologist will be assigned to All COVID-19 positive and PUI patients
 Guidelines for Neuroimaging
Brain Imaging
 As with any flu-like illness, mental status changes are common and may not require brain
imaging.
 If stroke is of clinical concern, a neurology consult should be requested.
 CT Head should be used judiciously because of the risk of exposure during transport and image
acquisition.
 MRI Brain should be avoided due to potential environmental contamination. CT Head can
exclude intracranial hemorrhage. MRI Brain is unlikely to change management.
 Carotid imaging may be considered following neurology consultation, and to investigate
pathology requiring immediate intervention.
Spinal Imaging
 Imaging should be reserved for patients with neurologic findings suggesting either cord
compression, traumatic cord injury, or if there is a clinical concern for osteomyelitis and possible
epidural abscess.
 For back pain in the absence of trauma or evidence of infection, conservative therapy without
imaging should be pursued, as previously outlined by the consensus panel at HUMC.
 If absolutely essential, imaging for patients with high-likelihood of non-infectious, non-
neoplastic ideologies for back pain should be pursued with limited range CT, tailored to the level
clinical concern. Radiation doses will be increased to provide more diagnostic imaging of the
contents of the spinal canal.
17
Note: Utilization of MR imaging for COVID+ cases or PUIs necessitates a terminal clean of the unit,
resulting in a 3-4 hour downtime.
18
B. HUMC Cardiac Cath Lab Policy for Invasive Procedures for COVID-19 Patients
Catheterization Laboratory
Elective Patients are postponed at the present time until deemed clinical necessary by primary provider.
All STEMI Patients regardless of COVID-19 positive or Suspected COVID status are continuing to follow
the STEMI protocol of receiving diagnostic catheterization and primary PCI procedures.
Positive COVID-19 patients:
All procedures will comply with Infection Control prevention recommendations including: PPE to be
donned by team including a N95 mask with additional team outside the room to hand in product as
needed throughout the procedure. Two HEPA filters will be in place in the room throughout the
procedure. Terminal cleaning of the room to be completed after procedure and EVS contacted to clean
the HEPA filters.
NSTEMI and Suspected COVID patients: Prior to performing catheterization procedures the results of
patients with suspected COVID-19 status should be determined
Clinical differentiation of Type 2 AMI vs. Primary Acute Coronary Syndrome
Follow the ACC recommendations suggesting deferment of Type 2 AMI for invasive management if
hemodynamically stable
Unstable NSTEMI Patients: If patient's status changes to become unstable due to ACS the above
mentioned STEMI process will be implemented
C. HUMC ECMO Policy for COVID-19 Patients
It is the purpose of this policy to help in the clinical decision making for initiation of treatment with
ECMO in patients with known or suspected SARS-coronavirus-2 infection and severe respiratory failure,
while preventing infectious disease transmission in scenarios where droplets can be aerosolized.
Key Points
- Huddle between the ECMO Treatment Team (CCU, MICI, CT ICU and SICU Directors/Chiefs, Cardiac
Surgery Leadership, Perfusionists, and Operating Room Leadership) to determine the risk/benefit of
the treatment.
- Final approval of the treatment will be by Dr. Mark Anderson and/or Dr. George Bastides.
- Perform procedure at the bedside in a negative pressure environment.
- ECMO Perfusionists rounding at least twice/day for patients undergoing ECMO treatment.
- CT-ICU Nurse supervision/assignment of the patient on ECMO treatment.
- Patients on ECMO will be under the care of the CT-ICU/CT Surgery Team regardless of the patient's
location.
- Assign a Team member to observe the correct procedures for donning and doffing using a checklist.
- Only in-patients at Hackensack University Medical Center will be considered for ECMO treatment.
o Patients currently admitted at other institutions will be evaluated by members of the
ECMO Treatment Team for appropriateness of transfer to Hackensack University
19
Medical Canter for the purpose of ECMO treatment with final approval by Dr. Mark
Anderson and/or George Bastides.
Procedure
 Once a patient with severe hypoxemia and droplet/airborne isolation has been identified, a
huddle will be held by the ECMO Treatment Team to determine the best course of therapy and
to assess the risk/benefits of the treatment.
 The Team will follow the present indications for ECMO as per the HUMC Protocol.
 Signs will be posted outside the Intensive Care Unit where the procedure is taking place and
Security or designated Team members will be in charge of traffic control.
 A health care professional will be identified as an outside circulating resource, responsibility will
include:
o Obtaining any necessary supplies and equipment needed.
o Preventing unnecessary traffic flow in and out of the room.
 Any person entering the procedure room should use droplet/airborne precautions including full
Personal Protective Equipment.
 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be worn includes:
o A N95 mask, for which one has been fit-tested.
o Face shield or disposable goggles.
o A level 3 gown.
o Double gloving
 All PPE should be removed in the procedure room with the exception of the N95 mask.
 Removal of the N95 mask occurs once the Team is outside the room. Dispose of the mask as per
Infectious Control Policy.
 Hand hygiene is essential before donning and after doffing.
 The same procedure will be followed at the time of de-cannulation, unless a surgical procedure
is required to accomplish that task. For the latter situation, Hybrid Cath Lab Room 10 is the
designated operating room and the procedure will follow the ""Droplet/Airborne Precautions in
the Perioperative Area"" policy.
Not part of this policy, but highly recommended is the participation in a National/International registry
to determine effectiveness and safety of ECMO in this patient population.
D. Guidelines for Prone Positioning for Non-Intubated Adult Patients with ARDS
Orders for Prone Positioning of Non-Intubated Patients can be received by
 Critical care providers or critical care designees
 COVID-19 Hospitalist care providers
 Orders must include prone-supine frequency, schedule, and duration
o Recommendations are 2-4 hours twice daily and sleeping in the prone position.
Indications for Prone Positioning of Non-Intubated Patients

 Patients receiving tube feeding: Evaluation of gastric residual volume and hold tube feeding 1
hour prior to prone positioning.
 Resuming and holding of tube feeding will be at the discretion of the provider.
 Patients requiring telemetry monitoring. Place EKG leads/electrodes on patient back.
21
 Application of appropriate skin protections (e.g. multilayer foam dressing with silicone) should
be implemented to avoid pressure injury.
 If necessary, eye and oral care should occur prior to and during prone positioning.
 Prone Positioning
o Performed by the appropriate number of team members required to assist the patient
with repositioning.
 For conscious, cooperative patients, encourage self-proning when appropriate.
 Patients must have the ability to be able to remove themselves from the prone
position if the position can no longer be tolerated.
 Consider placing pillows over bony prominences, across chest near 3rd intra-
costal space, across pelvic bone, and under knees.
o When placing the patient in the prone position
 Use the appropriate number of team members to safely execute the position
change
 Disconnect any non-essential equipment.
 Ensure all remaining lines, tubes, and drains, oxygen have adequate length and
flexibility. After position change re-sure all required lines, tubes, and drains.
 Ensure the abdomen is unrestricted.
 During prone position, if possible, obtain at least one arterial blood gas to evaluate effects.
 Document in the electronic medical record the amount time the patient is in a prone position.
Items to consider for documentation start time, end time, patient tolerance, and total prone
time.
 Consider returning patient to the supine position.
o Patient unable to maintain or tolerate prone position
o SaO2 is less than 88% for sustained periods of time.
o Blood pressure SBP less than 90, MAP less than 65
o HR less than 60 or greater than 130 for sustained periods of time

F. Palliative Care Considerations
a. Consider placing Palliative Care consult in EPIC for goals of care discussion and/or symptoms related
to end of life care (EOLC). If implementing EOLC, use EOLC order set in EPIC and consider compassionate
extubation or ventilator de-escalation. [Note: With Ventilator de-escalation, endotracheal tube will
remain in place and ventilator circuit will remain intact until the patient has died. This may reduce risk of
exposure of Covid-19 to visitors and bedside staff]

Objectives

To assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity and the occurrence and features of Covid-19 in a Covid-free urologic unit in a regional hospital in Northern Italy.

Methods

Our Department is the only urologic service in the Trento Province, near Lombardy, the epicenter of Covid-19 in our Country. We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11-April 7).

Results and Conclusions

63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19. In order to preserve its integrity, we propose an
enhanced triage
prior to the admission to a Covid-free unit including not only routine questions on fever and respiratory symptoms but also non-respiratory symptoms, history of exposure, and a survey about the social and geographic origin of the patient."

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused respiratory failure and associated mortality in numbers that have overwhelmed global health systems. Thrombotic coagulopathy is present in nearly three-quarters of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and both the clinical picture and pathologic findings are consistent with microvascular occlusive phenomena being a major contributor to their unique form of respiratory failure. Numerous studies are ongoing focusing on anti-cytokine therapies, antibiotics and anti-viral agents, but none to-date have focused on treating the underlying thrombotic coagulopathy in an effort to improve respiratory failure in COVID-19. There is animal data and a previous human trial demonstrating a survival advantage with fibrinolytic therapy to treat ARDS. Here we review the extant and emerging literature on the relationship between thrombotic coagulopathy and pulmonary failure in the context of COVID-19 and present the scientific rationale for consideration of targeting the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to improve pulmonary function in these patients.

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires ventilation in critically ill patients. The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state. Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy. However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis. In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial. Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

In early December 2019 multiple cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
1
-
3
In January 2020 the World Health Organization declared that this was caused by a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been exponential, resulting in a global pandemic with more than two million confirmed cases. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild illness, characterized by a fever and continuous cough,
2
approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support and 5% require admission to intensive care. COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress present primarily with severe hypoxemia, yet respiratory system compliance can vary from near normal to exceptionally low.
4
In severe cases, patients with COVID-19 develop a type of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Older age and co-morbidities are associated with higher mortality.
5

A hallmark of ARDS is increased alveolar-capillary permeability triggered by exudation of fluid rich in cells and plasma proteins, including albumin, fibrinogen, proinflammatory cytokines, and coagulation factors
6
,
7
(Figure
1
). This leads to recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, including neutrophils,
8
alveolar macrophages,
9
monocytes, and platelets, which propagate the local inflammatory response.
10
Fibrin deposition in the air spaces and lung parenchyma are consistently observed with ARDS and contribute to hyaline-membrane formation and subsequent alveolar fibrosis.
11
-
14
This promotes the development and progression of respiratory dysfunction and right heart failure.
15
Fibrin deposition is the net result of an alteration in the balance of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, and several therapeutic strategies have been explored to target the dysfunction of these systems in ARDS.
16
-
19
Recent case studies describe fibrin deposits in biopsies of lung tissue from patients with COVID-19,
20
,
21
with ARDS commonly reported.
22
,
23
Consistent with this, large numbers of infiltrating immune cells have been found in COVID-19 positive lung tissues, particularly monocytes and macrophages,
21
,
23
-
25
alongside the formation of fibrin,
15
,
21
,
25
proteinaceous hyaline membranes, and pulmonary fibrosis.
24
,
25
Computed tomography (CT) scans of COVID-19 patients' lungs reveal characteristic ground glass opacities (GGO), indicating partial filling of the bronchoalveolar airspace with exudate.
26
,
27
The timing of the accidental sampling in the COVID-19 patients with lung cancer suggests these early fibrin lung depositions present prior to clinical symptoms of pneumonia.
21
Therefore, biomarkers to allow early identification of these changes would be highly beneficial in early diagnosis and timely treatment of COVID-19 patients. This review will focus on the molecular mechanisms and role of inflammatory cells in underpinning fibrin deposition and persistence in the lungs of critically ill COVID-19 patients and discuss potential therapeutic strategies to help support these patients.

Development of fibrin deposits in the alveolar space. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes to the pulmonary vasculature and alveolar air space. This leads to a massive insult in the alveolar-capillary membrane and exudation of fluid rich in cells and plasma proteins, including coagulation factors and fibrinogen. Damage to the endothelial membrane and pulmonary vasculature allows accumulation of coagulation factors within the alveoli. Tissue factor (TF) exposed on the surface of damaged endothelial cells and on the surface of macrophages and monocytes promotes fibrin formation. High levels of tissue necrosis factor b
1
(TNF-b
1
) activate neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and amplify TF exposure on the surface of macrophages and monocytes. Elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) expression on the surface of monocytes and macrophages prevents degradation of fibrin deposits by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)

2 THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN ARDS

Sequestration of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, within the microvasculature of the lung is central to the development of ARDS, leading to a massive insult to the alveolar-capillary membrane, unrestricted inflammation, and microthrombus formation (reviewed by Matthay et al
28
). Neutrophils, resident alveolar macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages, as well as recruited monocytes, infiltrate the lungs, enhance lung injury, and play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS.
29
-
32
Release of proinflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a), encourage ongoing infiltration of immune cells from the intravascular compartment to the alveolar airspaces.
33
-
35
Indeed, these proinflammatory cytokines are used as biomarkers of ARDS and have been suggested to be important in progression of COVID-19 associated ARDS.
28

Accumulation of coagulation factors in the lungs can also drive ARDS through the activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), which are expressed on cells in the lungs including alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, and macrophages.
36
,
37
PAR signalling induced by tissue factor, coagulation factor Xa, factor VIIa, or thrombin can augment fibrosis in addition to driving fibrin generation. Fibrosis is characterized by fibroblast migration, proliferation, and deposition of collagen in the intra-alveolar spaces. PAR-1 can be acted upon in fibroblasts by both thrombin and factor Xa to promote their proliferation, induce production of pro-collagen, and amplify expression of various growth factors including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).
38
,
39
PAR signalling can enhance inflammation in acute lung injury (ALI) by increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6,
40
IL-8,
40
-
42
and platelet derived growth factor.
43

Accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs further contributes to the pathophysiology of ARDS.
28
Neutrophils release their DNA alongside their nuclear and cytoplasmic contents into the extracellular environment during the cell death process, NETosis. These web-like cellular extrusions, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) form a scaffold of chromatin decorated with cytoplasmic and granule proteins and histones. NETs play a role in the fight against invading pathogens. However, if not tightly regulated, NETs can contribute to the pathogenesis of non-infectious diseases where they can exacerbate coagulation and inflammation
44
and have recently been reported as a contributing player in the pathogenesis of ARDS and ALI where they cause further damage to the lungs.
45
,
46
NET production has been identified in the lungs during ARDS, where levels of NETs are greatly increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of both ARDS patients and mouse models of induced ALI and ARDS.
45
,
47
-
49
Increased NETs correlate with the severity of ARDS
45
,
48
and disease severity is reduced in mouse models when NETs are degraded using DNase1.

3 DYSREGULATION OF COAGULATION AND FIBRINOLYSIS IN ARDS

A hypercoagulable state exists in the lungs of ARDS patients, leading to the deposition of fibrin in the intra-alveolar space
50
(Figure
1
). Inflammation modulates coagulation by activating C-reactive protein (CRP), thereby augmenting tissue factor exposure on monocytes and alveolar macrophages
51
,
52
which in turn promote thrombin generation and deposition of fibrin. Hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen, an acute phase protein, is increased 2- to 10-fold in plasma during infection
53
and local synthesis in the lung epithelium is evident during pneumonia
54
thereby further exacerbating fibrin deposition. Fibrin deposition augments inflammation and fibrosis as well as damaging lung surfactant.
49
,
55
,
56

This is coupled with a hypofibrinolytic state in the alveolar space, where fibrinolytic inhibitors have been shown to be elevated. Levels of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and protein C inhibitor were found to be significantly elevated in the bronchoalveolar fluid of patients with interstitial lung disease when compared to healthy controls.
57
Furthermore, it has been reported that a2-macrogloblin levels are increased in obstructive lung disease, which may correlate with the increase in plasminogen observed in the BAL of ARDS patients.
58
,
59
However, the principal fibrinolytic inhibitor described in the pathogenesis of ARDS is plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which is known to be elevated in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ALI.
11
,
60

In ARDS, CRP promotes local release of PAI-1 from endothelial cells.
61
,
62
Additionally, infiltration of platelets, the major circulating pool of PAI-1, may result in local release. We have recently shown that a significant amount of this active PAI-1 remains associated with the stimulated platelet membrane.
63
,
64
Elevated levels of PAI-1 in ARDS depresses urokinase (uPA) activity in the bronchoalveolar fluid.
11
Attenuation of the plasminogen activation system leads to abnormal turnover of fibrin in the alveolar space. Plasma PAI-1 levels have been reported as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis and mortality in ALI.
59
,
61
,
62
,
65
-
68
Prabhakaran et al
61
reported a significant increase in PAI-1 antigen and activity in plasma and the edema fluid in ALI, with evidence of significant pulmonary production.
61
A clear role for PAI-1 as a prognostic marker in ARDS was confirmed by a prospective observational study which demonstrated 5-fold higher levels in patients who progressed to ARDS than those with uncomplicated aspiration pneumonitis (2687 versus 587 ng/mL, respectively).
67

Importantly, a hypofibrinolytic state and increased PAI-1 was observed in the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002 and 2003.
60
Gralinski et al used a non-biased systems biology approach to study the dysfunctional fibrinolytic pathway in an infection model of SARS-CoV.
60
Fibrin persistence was mediated by over-expression of PAI-1, which overcomes local uPA and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).
60
SARS-CoV infected cells contain high levels of TGF-b1, which in turn stimulates expression of extracellular matrix protease inhibitors, including PAI-1,
68
which has been specifically linked to ARDS induced by SARS-CoV.
69
These studies illustrate a clear role for PAI-1 in the etiology of ARDS and suggest it is a key protein contributing to abnormal turnover of fibrin in the alveolar space.

Plasma PAI-1 has been reported as a potential biomarker for predicting disease progression in ALI to ARDS, with one study concluding that PAI-1 antigen > 640 ng/mL was a 100% positive predictor for mortality.
61
Similar pathology of fibrin depositions in the lungs has been identified in COVID-19,
21
,
25
suggesting PAI-1 may be a useful prognostic marker for patients at risk of developing ARDS and thus requiring critical care and ventilation.

4 THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR ARDS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS

A common finding with COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization is increased levels of D-dimers and fibrin degradation products (FDP) which are associated with a higher risk of mortality.
70
Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time show a mild elongation.
70
Coupled with the fact critically ill COVID-19 patients will be immobilized, there is an increased risk of hospital-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE).
71
These findings have led to a recent recommendation for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, without contraindications, to limit the extent of the coagulopathy.
72
,
73
Heparin treatment (both unfractionated and LMWH) reduces inflammatory biomarkers,
74
and therefore may be beneficial in reducing the inflammatory state in COVID-19. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often observed in patients with ARDS where fibrin and microthrombi are detected in the lungs
12
and BAL.
59
Consistent with this, numerous patients infected during the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002-2003 displayed DIC
75
and elevated levels of fibrinogen
76
and D-dimers.
77

Anticoagulant therapy is essential to limit ongoing fibrin deposition and microthrombi formation in ARDS and treat the systemic prothrombotic complications in these patients. However, LMWH will be ineffective in clearing fibrin clusters deposited in the alveolar space. There is therefore a requirement to readdress the balance of fibrinolysis in the lung, either by enhancing plasminogen activation or downregulating fibrinolytic inhibitors. The significant increase in PAI-1 in ARDS and ALI curtails local uPA, but also tPA, activity.
11
,
17
,
78
,
79
In a pig model of trauma, administration of tPA or uPA prevented development of ARDS, with animals displaying normal PaO
2
.
80
A phase 1 clinical trial revealed a significant improvement in PaO
2
at 24 hours in 19 out of 20 patients with severe ARDS secondary to trauma or sepsis following administration of uPA or streptokinase.
81
,
82
These patients had a PaO
2
of <60 mm Hg, usually considered fatal, which increased to 231.5 mm Hg following thrombolytic therapy with an overall 30% survival rate and no incidence of bleeding.
82
The use of tPA to treat ARDS in COVID-19 patients has recently been proposed by Moore et al.
15
An initial case report from three patients from the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates a transient improvement in P/F ratio in two cases and sustained 50% improvement in one case following administration of a 25 mg bolus of intravenous tPA followed by a further 25 mg infusion.
83
The authors suggest that there is a precedent for increasing the dose of the bolus of tPA while maintaining heparin infusion, as the anticoagulant is effective against sub-massive pulmonary embolism.
83
,
84
In addition to readdressing the fibrinolytic balance, administration of tPA to ARDS patients may confer anti-inflammatory effects, as it has been shown to suppress neutrophil activation in a rat model of ALI induced by IL-1a.
85

A major consideration in anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy is the undesirable complication of bleeding. In respiratory medicine, treatments are often delivered as aerosolized protein therapeutics as diffusion of proteins from the blood to the lungs can be limited.
86
Interestingly, nebulized anticoagulant therapy with antithrombin or heparin has been shown to reduce lung injury without an increase in systemic bleeding in animal models
87
-
89
and ALI patients.
90
However, as discussed, heparin will prevent further fibrin deposition but will be ineffective in the removal of pre-existing fibrin. A recent publication compared the efficacy of the nebulized form of the plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and nebulized heparin in the treatment of ARDS.
91
The primary outcome in this trial was the change in PaO
2
/FIO
2
ratio, which was significantly higher in the streptokinase group from day 1 to day 8, compared to the heparin and standard-of-care groups. Importantly, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was significantly lower in streptokinase patients compared to other groups.
91
A 1999 case report
92
describes a young woman with ARDS who was resistant to conventional therapeutics and was treated with nebulized and intravenous tPA, followed by continuous treatment with nebulized unfractionated heparin. The patient stabilized following fibrinolytic treatment and demonstrated a significant enhancement in pulmonary gas exchange.

Plastic bronchitis is a condition that can develop from several respiratory disorders, resulting in casts of compacted mucous that have been shown to contain fibrin.
93
Plastic bronchitis is primarily observed in children and has been described in cases of influenza A (H1N1)
94
,
95
and human bocavirus.
96
Nebulized tPA has been shown to be effective in preventing recurrent cast formation in plastic bronchitis.
93
Reports thus far are from single case studies; however, there is an ongoing phase II clinical trial of nebulized tPA (PLATyPuS; alteplase, NCT02315898) for treatment of plastic bronchitis. These data clearly indicate that use of nebulized fibrinolytics could allow a more targeted approach to correct the hemostatic imbalance that results in fibrin deposition, while limiting the risk of systemic activation of fibrinolysis that may trigger unwanted bleeding (Figure
2
). Inhaled tPA is absorbed into the vasculature thus increasing fibrinolytic capacity in the plasma
97
and the potential to lyse the microthrombi observed in COVID-19 patients. However, it is conceivable that intravenous infusions of tPA may be necessary to disperse larger thrombi in the circulation. A potential caveat of a nebulizer formulation is that aerosolized proteins are susceptible to degradation so the formulation and excipient used must be considered.
86
However, in the case of tPA, an extreme advantage is that a formulation of nebulized alteplase has been developed and is currently being tested in a Phase II clinical trial.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated a demand for novel therapeutics to limit the complications of ARDS and/or reduce the burden on ventilatory support in intensive care units. The indication that fibrin deposits occur prior to symptoms
21
of the disease suggests that targeting the fibrinolytic system to promote fibrin resolution could limit severity and improve pulmonary function. Given the urgent time scale of the clinical requirement, repurposing of existing therapies, such as nebulized tPA, to promote fibrin dissolution in the lung and improve oxygenation is a pragmatic approach in addressing the ARDS complications associated with COVID-19.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes patients to a prothrombotic state with demonstrated microvascular involvement. The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes, however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography (TEG) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events.

Methods

Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 diagnoses that had TEG analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure.

Results

Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted VTE with an AUROC of .742 (p=0.021). A D-Dimer cutoff of 2600 ng/ml predicted need for dialysis with an AUROC of .779 (p=0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004).

Conclusions

Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.

Patients with COVID-19 have frequent complications of venous thromboembolism, stroke, and kidney failure. A lack of any clot lysis on thromboelastogram combined with elevated D-dimer levels identifies a high-risk population potentially requiring more aggressive anticoagulation."

The potential synergism between viral infection and the resulting hypercoagulability related to increased lipoprotein(a) levels merits further investigation …,"Early data from Wuhan, China, show that patients with COVID-19 are typically male, aged 40 to 60 years, and about one-third have comorbidities. Moreover, of 138 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan and treated in an intensive care unit (ICU), 25% had cardiovascular disease and 58% hypertension; the respective figures for non-ICU-treated COVID-19 patients were10% and 22% [
1
]. Based on these early data, a predisposition to acute cardiac complications related to underlying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may significantly increase the severity of COVID-19 in susceptible individuals.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an inherited disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 250. It is characterized by a lifelong two- to threefold elevation of plasma LDL cholesterol concentration, which if untreated induces premature ASCVD and a markedly increased risk of an acute coronary event in middle-aged FH patients. These epidemiological data suggest that, compared with non-FH patients, FH patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk of cardiac complications, particularly if the underlying genetic disease has remained undetected. Concern is justified because a high proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients are under the age of 50. Below this age, clinicians typically overlook the possibility of an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease, even amongst patients with FH in whom subclinical stenosing coronary artery disease may already start to develop during their early 30s.

In patients with FH, it is possible that LDL-receptor variants exist which modulate the long-term immune response to COVID-19, as has been shown for hepatitis C infection [
2
]. Overall, there is increasing awareness of the involvement of host genetic factors in infectious diseases. Coronavirus infections may induce long-term abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism, with clear adverse implications for FH patients, and, additionally, chronic
Chlamydia pneumoniae
infection is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in patients with FH [
3
,
4
]. An important finding is the association between cytomegalovirus antibodies and atherosclerosis, which in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study was observed in individuals with high levels of lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen [
5
]. Such an association may also apply to FH patients who have, on average, higher lipoprotein(a) levels compared with the general population [
6
] and, therefore, may have a higher risk of an atherothrombotic event whilst suffering from COVID-19 and even after recovery. The potential synergism between viral infection and the resulting hypercoagulability related to increased lipoprotein(a) levels merits further investigation.

There are several important considerations when treating an FH patient with COVID-19, including the need to intensify cholesterol-lowering treatment because of potential coronary endothelial dysfunction caused by the viral infection [
7
]. Statin treatment, the primary LDL cholesterol-lowering pharmacotherapy for patients with FH, may protect against endothelial dysfunction and an acute coronary event and, therefore, should not be discontinued in patients undergoing intensive care, especially those with established coronary artery disease. Because PCSK9 inhibitors effectively lower LDL cholesterol and prevent acute coronary events in FH, their use should also be continued. PCSK9 inhibitors have a good safety profile; however, experience of their use in severely ill COVID-19 patients is limited and worthy of evaluation [
8
].

Thus, it appears that an FH patient may be more prone to acute complications of COVID-19 than a healthy person of a similar age. In agreement with this notion, the cholesterol charity HEART UK (
https://www.heartuk.org.uk/news/coronavirus
), in the very recent patient information about COVID-19, has stated that patients with FH and diagnosed heart disease are considered to be at high risk and that elderly FH patients and FH patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease or diabetes may also be at high risk. Similar concerns have been raised by the FH Foundation (
https://thefhfoundation.org/letter-to-the-fh-community-about-covid-19
).

Finally, patients with FH are likely to be at increased long-term risk of an atherothrombotic event following COVID-19, as previously observed in FH patients with
Chlamydiapneumoniae
infection [
4
] as well as in the general population with influenza or cytomegalovirus infection [
5
,
7
]. Thus, pharmacotherapy for severe hypercholesterolaemia in an FH patient with COVID-19 should not be discontinued during infection and, due to possible excess risk of ASCVD, could even be intensified following recovery from COVID-19. Of importance, however, the potential advantages of intensifying lipid-lowering therapy for FH patients after the first COVID-19 epidemic, and the potential disadvantages of a lack of intensification, need to be explored in future epidemiological investigations.

Background: Little is known about factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness in Covid-19 positive patients.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters.
Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age >=75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation <88% (OR 6.99, 95% CI 4.5-11.0), d-dimer>2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), ferritin >2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) >200 (OR 5.78, 95% CI, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age >65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was SpO2<88, followed by procalcitonin >0.5, troponin <0.1 (protective), age >64 and CRP>200.
Conclusions: Age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with critical illness.

-The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the investigational new drug (IND) application submitted by Octapharma USA for a phase three clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of Octagam
(r)
10% [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] therapy in COVID-19 patients with severe disease progression.

The primary objective of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study is to determine if high-dose Octagam
(r)
10% therapy will slow or stop respiratory deterioration in patients with severe coronavirus disease. The secondary objectives of the study are to measure the effects of a high-dose of Octagam
(r)
10% on slowing or stopping the clinical progression of COVID-19 by improving pulmonary function, quality of life, and correlated impact on metabolic factors.

""Although many therapies based on provisional data have been proposed for patients who suffer from COVID-19, known treatments are limited,"" said Octapharma USA President Flemming Nielsen. ""Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which consists of pooled IgG preparations from thousands of donors, has been used to treat patients with immune-mediated diseases for almost 40 years. Our hypothesis is that the use of IVIG in the prophylaxis of severe infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, makes it an attractive therapeutic possibility for COVID-19.""

The study will begin immediately at approximately 10 U.S. research sites with the goal of enrolling about 54 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a resting SpO2 of <=93%, requiring oxygen supplementation. SpO2, also known as oxygen saturation, is a measure of the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood relative to the amount of hemoglobin not carrying oxygen.

Patients in the trial will be randomized to receive either Octagam
(r)
10% or a placebo, and will be monitored for approximately 33 days. Those receiving Octagam
(r)
10% will be administered a total dose of 2 g/kg as an intravenous infusion of 0.5 g/kg over a two-hour period daily for four consecutive days. Octapharma hopes to report study results by the third quarter of 2020.

""Several case reports on utilizing IVIG treatment for COVID-19 patients have shown positive results,"" said Wolfgang Frenzel, M.D., Head of Research & Development at Octapharma. ""The effects of the immune-modulating properties of IVIG in severely-ill COVID-19 patients appeared to be demonstrated in the case reports and we are, therefore, hopeful that we will observe improved clinical status in the patients receiving Octagam

Ocular complications in critical care patients are common. There has been a surge in intensive care admissions following the COVID-19 outbreak. The management of COVID-19 exposes patients to a number of specific risk factors for developing ocular complications, which include non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Consequently, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of ocular complications secondary to the management of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit setting, and these complications could lead to permanent visual loss and blindness. Increased awareness of eye care in the intensive care unit setting is therefore vital to help prevent visual loss and maintain quality of life for patients recovering from COVID-19.

Background

The COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic and a global health emergency by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 (
World Health Organization, 2020a
). There were 3 862 676 confirmed cases worldwide with 265 961 deaths related to COVID-19, with 211 368 of these cases confirmed and 31 241 deaths in the UK, as of 9 May 2020 (
World Health Organization, 2020b
). This has seen a surge in patients being admitted to critical care units across the UK, with the capacity of these units increased to accommodate this demand, resulting in unprecedented numbers of patients receiving critical care treatment. This treatment often involves non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation because an acute respiratory distress syndrome-like condition can develop in COVID-19 patients (
Phua et al, 2020
). Prone positioning of mechanically ventilated patients (lying chest down) significantly improves oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (
Guerin et al, 2004
), as well as reducing mortality when used early and for 16 hours a day or more (
Sud et al, 2014
).

Ocular complications in critically unwell patients are common. Up to 42% of intensive care unit patients can have signs of damage to the corneal surface of the eye (exposure keratopathy), which can lead to secondary complications and ultimately irreversible visual loss (
Rosenberg and Eisen, 2008
;
Bird et al, 2017
). Visual impairment is associated with a reduced quality of life, loss of independence, reduced mobility and poor mental health; an increased rate of all-cause mortality has also been found in individuals with visual impairment (
Swanson and McGwin, 2004
;
Vu et al, 2005
;
Langelaan et al, 2007
;
Christ et al, 2014
). It is likely that the rise in intensive care unit admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly increase resulting ocular complications. Therefore, if these patients receive correct eye care, visual loss and its associated morbidity can be prevented.

This article provides an overview of ocular complications in critically unwell patients for health-care professionals involved in eye care in the intensive care unit setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pathophysiology of ocular surface disease in intensive care patients

The surface structures of the eye are most at risk from damage in the intensive care patient, specifically the cornea (the transparent anterior surface of the eye). The main refractive power of the eye is provided by the cornea, which enables light to be focused onto the retina (
Hearne et al, 2018
). The cornea is densely innervated by pain fibres and is protected by production of the tear film, the blink reflex and the ability to maintain eyelid closure while asleep. Sedated patients are at high risk of developing complications as a result of corneal exposure; 75% of patients who are heavily sedated have incomplete closure of the eyelid, known as lagophthalmos (
Mercieca et al, 1999
;
Rosenberg and Eisen, 2008
).
Table 1
outlines assessment of lid closure. Tonic contraction of the orbicularis muscle maintains lid closure during sleep and the blink reflex regulates regular eye closure while awake, helping to protect the ocular surface by continuously distributing the tear film across the cornea.

In critical care patients, muscle relaxants reduce tonic contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle which can lead to lagophthalmos. Sedation or a reduced conscious level can reduce the blink rate and inhibit the protective blink reflex, as well as preventing patients from reporting symptoms of pain or discomfort which can alert clinicians to potential damage to the ocular surface (
Table 2
) (
Grixti et al, 2013
). Therefore, this exposes the ocular surface, predisposing the cornea to direct damage (corneal abrasion) or secondary complications, because of the loss of these protective mechanisms.

Ocular surface damage can also arise directly from gas flow from oxygen or non-invasive ventilation face masks which exert a direct drying effect on the corneal surface (
Mercieca et al, 1999
). Elevated venous pressure from positive pressure ventilation and/or prone positioning of ventilated patients, as seen in a number of COVID-19 patients, can result in conjunctival oedema (chemosis), exposing the surface of the eye as a result of mechanical lifting of the upper eyelid (
Grixti et al, 2013
). Indirect damage to the unprotected corneal surface is termed exposure keratopathy, and this can lead to secondary complications with the potential for permanent visual loss including microbial keratitis, corneal scarring and perforation (
Hearne et al, 2018
). Any damage of the corneal surface that causes scar tissue formation or an opacity of the cornea can reduce the amount of light entering the eye and alter its refractive power, leading to visual loss. Severe damage to the cornea can result in irreversible blindness, necessitating the need for corneal transplant. Therefore, the prevention, recognition and management of such conditions (by following local protocols where available) is vitally important in the critical care setting when patients are often unable to alert clinicians to potential ocular problems.

Corneal abrasion

Corneal abrasion is a common condition caused by a superficial breaching of the corneal epithelium. This results in a red and painful eye, and the abrasion can be identified with fluorescein eye drops, which stain the abrasion bright yellow/green when a blue light is applied (
Figure 1
). A simple corneal abrasion is treated with chloramphenicol ointment applied four times a day for 5-7 days (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Exposure keratopathy

Exposure keratopathy refers to damage of the corneal epithelium from prolonged exposure of the ocular surface to the outside environment, and primarily occurs secondary to incomplete lid closure (lagophthalmos). Patients can have a red eye, and fluorescein eye drops can reveal areas of staining as a result of damaged corneal epithelium (
Figure 2
). Treatment is of the underlying cause: preventative measures in the presence of lagophthalmos or removal of offending risk factors where possible (
Table 1
). If prolonged, exposure keratopathy can result in secondary corneal infection, ulceration and scarring (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Chemosis

Chemosis is swelling of the conjunctiva (
Figure 3
) as a result of increased venous pressure and subsequent oedema. This is common in patients who are ventilated in the prone position and also those with generalised oedema (such as in fluid overload, hypoalbuminaemia or capillary leak in systemic inflammatory response syndrome) (
Grixti et al, 2013
;
Hearne et al, 2018
). This chemosis can result in lagophthalmos, as the lid is unable to close fully over the ocular surface, and can cause uneven tear distribution, predisposing to exposure keratopathy and its associated complications (
Grixti et al, 2013
). Chemosis should be managed according to preventative measures outlined in
Table 3
. However, if severe these measures may not be adequate and referral to ophthalmology is required as it may be necessary to close the eyelids with sutures (tarsorrhaphy) to protect the ocular surface (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Recognition and management of other ocular complications in intensive care patients

Infection

In the intensive care unit setting the eye often becomes colonised with bacteria and respiratory secretions, which are a major cause of ocular infection in intubated patients;
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis
and
Acinetobacter
spp. are the most commonly isolated bacteria in this cohort (
Mela et al, 2010
). The infection is often spread to the eye in the process of endotracheal suctioning (
Ramirez et al, 2008
;
Hearne et al, 2018
). Therefore, covering the eyes during airway suctioning and avoiding direct contact between equipment and the eye can help to reduce infection rates (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Microbial keratitis

Most pathogens cannot penetrate an intact cornea, but loss of integrity of the corneal epithelium as a result of exposure keratopathy or corneal abrasion means corneal infection can occur, termed microbial keratitis (
Hearne et al, 2018
). Most cases of microbial keratitis are caused by bacteria (other causes are herpes zoster and herpes simplex viruses, and fungi) and result in a red eye, with an opacity on the cornea (
Figure 4
). Microbial keratitis can cause visual loss as a result of corneal scarring, and severe ulceration can lead to perforation of the cornea. Urgent ophthalmology referral is needed if microbial keratitis is identified (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Figure 4.
Microbial keratitis secondary to
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
. The light beam from the slit lamp is visible in the centre of eye with a round opacity on the inferior corneal surface as a result of bacterial infection.

Conjunctivitis

A red sticky eye in an intensive care patient can be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis (
Figure 5
). If no features of microbial keratitis are present, swabs of the discharge should be taken and sent for microbial culture and sensitivity, then the eyes cleaned separately. Chloramphenicol ointment should be applied to the affected eye four times a day for 7 days. If there is significant improvement within 24-48 hours treatment should continue regardless of sensitivity results, but if there is little or no improvement, treatment should be tailored to sensitivity results and an ophthalmology opinion sought (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Other ocular complications in intensive care unit patients

Although less common than conditions affecting the ocular surface, a number of other ocular complications can arise in the intensive care unit setting (
Table 3
). Reduced perfusion of ocular structures, damage to the optic nerve or more rarely a severe infection of the eye itself can lead to rapid and irreversible loss of vision (
Stambough et al, 2007
;
Grixti et al, 2012
). Intraocular pressure increases in patients ventilated in the prone position (
Saran et al, 2019
), as a result of direct compression of the eyes or as a result of gravitational effects leading to oedema, increased venous pressure and ocular swelling (
Cheng et al, 2001
). Raised intraocular pressure can lead to reduced ocular perfusion pressures, causing damage to the retina through occlusion of the blood supply (central retinal artery occlusion) or indirect damage to the optic nerve in the case of ischaemic optic neuropathy resulting in painless visual loss (
Stambough et al, 2007
). Prone ventilation during spinal and lung transplant surgery causes visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy (
Chang and Miller, 2005
;
Panchabhai et al, 2016
). The length and duration of prone positioning in managing COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure has the potential to cause visual loss in these patients as a result of ischaemic optic neuropathy.

More rarely patients nursed in the prone position can develop acute glaucoma in which the drainage of the eye becomes blocked as a result of forward movement of the lens and iris, causing a sudden and sustained rise in intraocular pressure (
Table 3
shows presenting features). This can rapidly cause devastating irreversible visual loss as a result of direct optic nerve damage (
Hearne et al, 2018
). Furthermore severe or persistent hypotension, which is common in intensive care unit patients, can also result in ischaemic optic neuropathy and permanent visual loss (
Stambough et al, 2007
). Endogenous endophthalmitis, a severe infection of the eye caused by systemic spread of infection through the bloodstream, should always be considered in a septic patient with a red eye (
Table 3
) (
Grixti et al, 2012
). Exogenous endophthalmitis most commonly occurs following ocular surgery but can also result from untreated microbial keratitis, which leads to ulceration and perforation of the cornea (
Bird et al, 2017
).

Protecting the eye in intensive care unit patients

Assessment of lid closure

Eyelid closure must be assessed at the time of admission and at least daily thereafter, with findings clearly documented. It is crucial to examine for the presence of incomplete closure of the eyelid (lagophthalmos) and, if it is present, the grade of severity must be assessed to help determine management (
Table 1
) (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Assessment of cornea and conjunctiva

The cornea and conjunctiva should be assessed at least daily with findings clearly documented in the notes (
Table 4
). For assessment, the eye should be opened and a bright light directed onto the surface of the eye to look for conjunctival redness, swelling, discharge and any opacities on the cornea. If there are concerns of corneal damage, further assessment can be carried out by applying fluorescein drops and viewing the cornea using a blue light (commonly found on ophthalmoscopes). It can be useful to obtain imaging of ocular surface pathology (following local policies and guidelines) for referral and monitoring purposes.

Applying preventative measures to protect the eye

Protective measures for the ocular surface should be initiated to prevent the development of exposure keratopathy secondary to lagophthalmos and its associated complications. Preventative measures in patients who are ventilated prone are also crucial to reduce the risk of associated complications from reduced retinal artery perfusion, ischaemic optic neuropathy and acute glaucoma (
Intensive Care Society and Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 2019
).

To apply ointment to the eye

Ointments are superior to eye drops in intensive care patients as they remain on the ocular surface for a longer period of time.
Figure 7
shows application instructions (
Hearne et al, 2018
). Ointment should be reapplied every 4 hours when indicated, with the eye cleaned before application to remove any old ointment. If administration of multiple different drops is required, there should be at least a 2-minute interval between the application of each set of drops. Ointment should always be applied after drops as ointment acts as a water repellent, preventing the absorption of drops (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
).

Figure 7.
Applying ointment to the eye.

To apply tape

If taping is required, as for grade 2 lagophthalmos (
Table 3
), ointment should first be applied to the eye in all cases. It is important to ensure that the surrounding skin is free from ointment to allow the tape to be secured correctly (
Figure 8
) (
Lightman and Montgomery, 2017
). Caution should be taken when removing tape from the eye to avoid any damage to the cornea from the lashes, fingers or tape.

Figure 8.
Taping of the eyelids.

Preventative measures in prone patients

An eye assessment should be carried out before proning (
Tables 3
and
4
), with the application of ointment and taping of the lids to prevent corneal abrasion during positioning (
Intensive Care Society and Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 2019
). When positioning patients prone, direct pressure on the eyes should be avoided and continuous re-assessment of this position undertaken. Maintaining normotension and adopting a slight reverse Trendelenburg position (30deg head-up positioning) decreases facial oedema and periorbital swelling, ensuring good ocular perfusion is maintained (
Stambough et al, 2007
). A proning checklist has been implemented in many hospitals to reduce complications, including those related to the eye. Part of the checklist includes ensuring the eyes are lubricated and taped and post-procedure the pressure areas are checked, ensuring there is no direct pressure on the eyes (
Intensive Care Society and Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 2019
).

Conclusions

Ocular complications in critically unwell patients are common. Given the unprecedented increase in intensive care unit admissions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely the number of these will increase. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients are exposed to specific risk factors for developing ocular complications, including non-invasive, mechanical and prone position ventilation. The consequence of this is a likely increase in the frequency of eye complications secondary to intensive care unit management, with the potential for permanent visual loss in these patients. Therefore, increased awareness of eye care and complications in the intensive care unit setting is vital to help prevent visual loss and maintain quality of life for those recovering from COVID-19.

Key points

Ocular complications are common in intensive care patients.

The management of COVID-19 exposes patients to a number of specific risk factors for developing ocular complications including prone position ventilation.

Common ocular complications in intensive care are often the result of incomplete closure of the eyelids (lagophthalmos) and include exposure keratopathy, corneal abrasion and microbial keratitis.

Ocular complications related to intensive care admission have the potential to lead to permanent visual loss and irreversible blindness.

Significant numbers of individuals recovering from COVID-19 to have substantial morbidity associated with visual loss."

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health threat. Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis."

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019. The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol."

Patients affected by severe coronavirus induced disease-2019 (Covid-19) often experience hypoxemia due to alveolar involvement and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the formation of micro thrombi in the pulmonary capillary vessels. Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death. To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking.

This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability.

We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer > 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group.

Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 mg/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 mg/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours. Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days. Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay. All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures.

Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results."

Emerging therapies for COVID-19, guidelines and recommendations

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. In recent months, with the spread of COVID-19, there has been growing interest in preventive and therapeutic treatments, but no effective strategies for either purpose have been confirmed by the available randomized controlled trials. Although future clinical trials may renew hope [
1
], management of COVID-19 is still exclusively supportive. The mechanism of infection with the causative agent of COVID-10, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), requires binding of viral spike (S) proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, a process facilitated by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and followed by downregulation of ACE2 [
2
]. The viral membrane then fuses with the host cell, and the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) is taken up via endocytosis. Within the host cell, it undergoes translation, proteolysis, RNA synthesis, new assembly, and exocytosis to further infect other cells. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, with a characteristic 'cytokine storm' component, has been recently proposed as a severe hyperinflammatory complication of COVID-19, driven by viral immune response [
3
]. Moreover, many COVID-19 patients suffer from abnormal coagulation, which has been associated with poor prognosis [
4
].

Recent advances have focused on a multi-target therapeutic strategy, taking inspiration from previous outbreaks of coronavirus infections, namely SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Nevertheless, no specific drugs are available for the treatment of either infection nor for COVID-19. With the current paucity of data, therapeutic choices that usually would never been adopted before appraising their utility is now being employed in an empiric and presumptive manner, moving away from core tenets of evidence-based medicine. Effective therapies are urgently needed.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors [
2
] have been proposed because they bind to ACE2. Data from Wuhan reported that a huge number of COVID-19 patients present with hypertension and RAAS inhibitors as daily antihypertensive therapy [
2
]. However, preclinical studies demonstrated that RAAS inhibitors may upregulate ACE2 expression, raising concerns as to their efficacy in COVID-19 (
Figure 1
) [
2
]. Conversely, abrupt withdrawal of RASS inhibitors in high-risk patients may result in clinical instability and adverse outcome. Clinical trials to determine whether the use of RASS inhibitors may affect the outcome in COVID-19 are ongoing (
Table 1
) [
2
].

Main drugs tested to date in SARS-CoV-2 infection and their potential mechanisms and sites of action in the viral infection and replication cycle. 1. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by binding the ACE2 receptor, with subsequent fusion and endocytosis (recombinant soluble ACE2 and losartan would act at this level). 2. Viral RNA is released, and transduction begins in the ribosome. 3. This is followed by proteolysis (may be inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir), which in turn is followed by translation and replication (RNA polymerases; may be inhibited by favipiravir and remdesivir). 5. Then, the ribosome synthesizes nucleocapsid proteins, which will encase RNA, and the viral envelope is assembled with the aid of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The now-complete virions are released, ready to infect other cells. 7. In parallel, a local and systemic immune response is now activated, and hypercoagulability ensues (modulated by corticosteroids and heparin). The IL-6 receptor can be inhibited by tocilizumab, and the IL-1 receptor, by anakinra. Bevacizumab acts by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Convalescent plasma reduces viral load.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have broad-spectrum antiviral activity
in vitro
by inhibiting virus entry into host cells through the inhibition of glycosylation, proteolysis, and endosomal acidification of host receptors. Both drugs also have immunomodulatory effects, attenuating cytokine production [
5
]. Very recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the available literature, as well as data from the Adverse Event Reporting System Database and the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System, suggesting that these drugs should be used only very cautiously in patients at increased risk of heart rhythm problems, especially considering the limitation of their use to hospital settings [
5
]. On May 7, an observational study of 1376 consecutive patients who received hydroxychloroquine was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
. The study concluded that hydroxychloroquine did not influence the time from enrollment to intubation or death [
6
], implying limited clinical utility and perhaps detrimental effects. Thus, we recommend that physicians not use hydroxychloroquine until new data from randomized-controlled trials become available (
Table 1
).

Antiretroviral agents, such as protease inhibitors and integrase strand transfer inhibitors, have also been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir did not result in benefits in terms of viral clearance or mortality rate in a randomized-controlled study of 199 COVID-19 patients. Randomization was made 13 days after symptom onset, suggesting that delayed initiation of therapy was probably associated with the inefficacy of treatment [
7
]. Other antiretrovirals are still undergoing preclinical testing, with possible evidence of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [
1
]. Favipiravir, a purine nucleoside leading to inaccurate viral RNA synthesis, has recently been approved for clinical trials to treat COVID-19 [
8
]. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, although was developed as a therapeutic agent for Ebola and Marburg virus infections with interesting results, preliminary data in COVID-19 did not show clinical benefit [
9
]; phase III clinical trials are ongoing (
Table 1
). In addition to various antiviral drugs already on the market, there are also several small-molecule compounds currently in research and development which have shown significant inhibitory effects on many key proteins from similar coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These drug candidates mostly inhibit viral enzymes, including proteases and components of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Since the 3C-like proteinase (3CL
pro
) has a high level of sequence homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, inhibitors tested against SARS-CoV 3CL
pro
may also be active against SARS-CoV-2 [
10
]. Because of their ability to interfere with viral replication, interferons and interferon fusion proteins have been utilized as therapeutic agents for the treatment of viral infections for more than 20 years. Finally, several RNA therapies have been developed, and, in addition to directly targeting the virus, antisense oligonucleotides could be used to target disease-related proteins involved in the inflammatory process. Convalescent plasma has also been shown to reduce viral load and improve outcome in COVID-19 patients [
11
].

The use of corticosteroids to modulate the inflammatory response in COVID-19 remains controversial. Based on an expert consensus [
12
-
14
], their use should be carefully weighed, according to clinical evidence: in patients already taking corticosteroids for chronic diseases, increased use should be evaluated with caution, with doses not exceed 0.5-1 mg/kg/day (methylprednisolone or equivalent) and for no longer than 7 days. The safety and efficacy of methylprednisolone in COVID-19 patients have been investigated in the clinical setting (
Table 1
). Interleukin (IL)-6 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response, showing both anti-and pro-inflammatory effects on cells that express the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), such as macrophages, neutrophils, and T-cells. Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, is designed to bind IL-6R. In 2017, it was approved for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome, which has prompted its possible use for COVID-19 in patients with higher levels of IL-6; efficacy remains unclear and requires confirmation [
3
]. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor inhibitor, may likewise induce a short-term reversible suppression of inflammation. However, both of these drugs might increase the risk of superinfections, making their clinical use for COVID-19 questionable [
3
]. Bevacizumab, a human monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has been studied in COVID-19 patients to reduce lung edema [
15
].

Immunoglobulin therapy is considered another potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. Two small case series (five and three, respectively) reported the use of immunoglobulins extracted from convalescent patients and the use of intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, respectively [
1
].

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated a good safety profile and possible efficacy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but whether these therapies are effective for treating COVID-19 remain unknown. Few studies have been published [
16
] and several others are ongoing. COVID-19 patients with different degrees of severity were treated with MSCs or placebo, and no adverse events were observed. However, further studies on dose, dosing strategies, and timing of administration are needed.

COVID-19 patients may also develop severe coagulopathy. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, alveolar macrophages and T cells, among other immune cells, are recruited and activated in an uncontrolled immune response leading to a cytokine storm, characterized by elevated serum levels of interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and IL-6, which foster thrombin activity [
4
]. Heparin is commonly administered to these patients. IL-1b and TNF-a target the glycocalyx via activation of metalloproteinases and heparanase, consequently reducing the content of proteoglycans (e.g., syndecan-1) and heparan sulfate, respectively. Glycocalyx shedding is linked to endothelial barrier rupture, which facilitates the increase of vascular permeability, leukocyte trafficking, and microthrombi. Heparin inhibits thrombin activity, protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress, and may modulate the cytokine storm [
17
].

Taken together, this evidence suggests that biologics have the potential to broaden the spectrum of treatment options for coronavirus-induced diseases. Prior knowledge and experience with the SARS and MERS outbreaks provide potential strategies for developing new target-specific therapeutic agents. However, COVID-19 has peculiar characteristics, and no strategies have demonstrated clear benefit to date; costs are also a concern.

Table 1
and
Figure 1
summarize the current studies ongoing, and the mechanisms implicated in the treatment of COVID-19.

In conclusion, the main mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 appears to be activation of the inflammatory cascade with a massive pro-coagulable state, which can lead to rapid deterioration including potentially fatal secondary conditions (e.g., thromboembolic events, superinfections). In our opinion, 'common' drugs such as steroids and heparin should be used routinely to modulate inflammation and coagulability. The possibility of superinfection is a concern with corticosteroid therapy, while increased risk of bleeding may be seen with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin. Strict monitoring of inflammatory (C-reactive protein, lymphocyte count, IL-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, etc.) and coagulation parameters (antithrombin III, prothrombin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, activated factor X) must be enforced and used to guide daily therapeutic management.

2. Expert opinion

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant therapeutic challenges. High fatality rates have been observed in COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, there has been growing interest in the development of new therapies capable of improving outcomes. At present, there is no evidence from randomized-controlled trials to support any therapeutic strategy as effective for COVID-19. Extensive studies have evaluated different potential strategies; however, to date, no treatment had improved outcomes or reduced fatality rates. Several drugs, including RAAS inhibitors (losartan, recombinant soluble ACE2), aminoquinolines (hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine), antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir), immunomodulators (steroids, anti-interleukin agents, intravenous immunoglobulin, mesenchymal stromal cells), and antithrombotics (heparin) have been studied. These studies have had several limitations, which seem to be associated with: 1) a lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia; 2) the difficulty of translating
in vitro
findings into clinical practice; and 3) the lack of proper clinical study designs to elucidate optimal dosage, timing, and population. SARS-CoV-2 is still a poorly known virus, and a better understanding of its transmission mechanisms, clinical spectrum of disease, diagnosis, and fatality rates is urgently needed. Future investigations should focus on new drugs targeting the pathophysiological pathways implicated in COVID-19. Moreover, several therapies which have been investigated may lead to more adverse effects than benefits. Evidence suggests there are different phenotypes of COVID-19, potentially distinguishable through distinct biomarkers, which may respond differently to treatments. Therefore, personalized approaches to COVID-19 management should be recommended, including the use of 'common' drugs such as heparin and steroids as part of daily clinical management. While we await the development of an effective vaccine, clinical trials should help define the best strategy to treat COVID-19 [

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious illness caused by a novel betacoronavirus
strain first recognized in December 2019. The etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV2,
is structurally related to viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These coronavirus
strains have been responsible for epidemics and high fatality rates in the past two
decades. COVID-19 is an active global health threat with conflicting fatality rate
reports, but known to be higher in hosts with pre-existing medical conditions and/or
advanced age.[1]"

The COVID pandemic has severely ravaged through Spain over the past weeks. The increasing number of affected patients in a short time required a quick reorganization of our healthcare system in order to encompass this huge amount of work and avoid the collapse of hospitals. It is a formidable effort for everyone and many of our colleagues have acquired infection in this process.

The case of a 36-year-old woman who was a healthcare worker and was brought by ambulance to the emergency room is reported.

Case report

Her mother had to contact the police because she was unable to talk to her on the phone for the last 48 h. She was found lying on her apartment floor unable to talk nor to move the right side of her body. She was on her own because her partner was taking care of his parents when the lockdown started and decided to stay with them during the state of emergency. She was a smoker, but no other previous medical history was known. Physical examination revealed a global aphasia and a right hemiplegia (National Institutes of Heart Stroke Scale 21). Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed an established infarct in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery with a mild deviation of the midline (Fig.
1a
). CT angiography showed an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery and the left anterior cerebral artery with a free-floating thrombus in the ascending aorta with no signs of aortic atheromatosis (Fig.
1b
,
c
). A thoracic CT revealed bilateral pneumonia and signs of bilateral acute pulmonary embolism. Polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed and was positive. Blood tests revealed elevated creatine kinase (8669 U/l) and D-dimer levels (7540 ng/ml), a C-reactive protein of 156 mg/ml and 23 600 white blood cells/ul. Because of the delay, the severe mass effect and the poor clinical status, it was decided not to perform hemicraniectomy. Her level of consciousness gradually deteriorated, and she passed away 72 h after admission.

(a) CT scan of the brain showed an established subacute infarct in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery with a mild deviation of the midline. (b) CT angiography shows the occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. (c) CT angiography shows a free-floating thrombus in the ascending aorta.

Discussion

The major clinical manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly due to pulmonary complications [
1
]. To date, the incidence of neurological symptoms in COVID patients remains unknown and, although several neurological symptoms have been reported, the biological mechanism remains unknown [
2
].

It is well known that COVID infection can induce changes in coagulation and other laboratory findings such as thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimers, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation which can lead to the development of thrombosis. However, its effects on systemic circulation and coagulation have not yet been established [
3
,
4
]. Under these circumstances, neurologists were fearing the collapse of our units and planning how to deal with the potential increase of our stroke patients. Surprisingly, a substantial reduction of neurological emergencies has been experienced during on-calls. This raises the question of whether these patients are being overlooked.

It is believed that this case illustrates the strong association between SARS-CoV-2 and the development of systemic thromboembolisms due to a hypercoagulable state, no matter the age of the patient. Thus, the awareness of neurologists about severe forms of systemic ischaemia and stroke in patients with signs of COVID infection need to be increased in order to provide all patients with the best possible care.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral pathogen that causes a clinical disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16IntCD44lowCD11bInt low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF-a levels, particularly for CD40+ LDIBs. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.

Abstract
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.
Methods
We retrospectively studied the relationship between RDW and COVID19 mortality risk for 1198 adult patients diagnosed with SARS COV2 at 4 Partners Healthcare Network Hospitals between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.
Findings
Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with increased mortality in patients of all ages with a risk ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8). Stratified by age, the risk ratio was 6.2 (4.4-7.9, N = 312) < 50 years, 3.2 (2.5-4.1, N = 230) 50-60, 2.3 (1.6-3.1, N = 236) 60-70, 1.2 (0.7-1.8, N = 203) 70-80, and 1.9 (1.5-2.3, N = 216) > 80 years. RDW was significantly associated with mortality in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-Dimer, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities (p < 1e-4 for RDW in all cases). Patients whose RDW increased during admission had a ~3-fold elevation in mortality risk compared to those whose RDW did not change.
Interpretation
Elevated RDW at diagnosis and an increase in RDW during admission are both associated with increased mortality risk for adult COVID19 patients at a large academic medical center network.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global health emergency. Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units.
METHODS: A single institution, two-centre retrospective analysis following implementation of a Decision Support tool and real-time data dashboard for early detection of patients requiring personalised enhanced care, focussing particularly on respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure, oxygenation indices, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin. Protocols differing from conventional practice included high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for all COVID-19 positive patients and antioxidant prescription.
RESULTS: By 22nd April 2020, 923 patients tested COVID-19 positive. 569 patients (61.7%) were male. The majority presented with advanced disease: interquartile ranges were C-reactive protein 44.9-179mg/L, D-dimer 1070-3802ng/L, and ferritin 261-1208mg/L. Completed case fatality rates were 25.1% [95% CI 20.0, 30.0] in females, 40.5% [95% CI 35.9, 45.0] in males. 139 patients were admitted to intensive care where current death rates are 16.2% [95% CI 3.8, 28.7] in females, 38.2% [95% CI 28.6, 47.8] in males with no trends for differences based on ethnicity. A real-time traffic lights dashboard enabled rapid assessment of patients using critical parameters to accelerate adjustments to management protocols. In total 513 (55.6%) of patients were flagged as high risk for thromboembolic disease, exceeding the numbers flagged for respiratory deteriorations (N=391, 42.4%), or cytokine storm (N=68, 7.4%). There was minimal evidence that age was associated with disease severity, but males had higher levels of all dashboard indices, particularly C-reactive protein and ferritin (p<0.0001) which displayed no relationship with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates are encouraging. Protocols employed (traffic light-driven personalised care, protocolised early therapeutic anticoagulation based on D-dimer >1,000ng/L and/or CRP>200 mg/L, personalised ventilatory strategies and antioxidants) are recommended to other units. Males are at greater risk of severe disease, most likely as the obligate SARS-CoV-2 receptor is on the X-chromosome, and require especially close, and early attention.

We report a 36-year-old woman in Iran who sought care for left shoulder pain and cough 5 days after a scheduled cesarean section. Acute pulmonary embolism and coronavirus disease were diagnosed. Physicians should be aware of the potential for these concurrent conditions in postpartum women.

An outbreak of viral pneumonia that emerged in late 2019 and spread rapidly worldwide was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (
1
). COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two other viruses of this family, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, also have caused outbreaks globally (
1
).

Venous embolism has been associated with severe infection. Acute pulmonary embolism has been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, but no cases have been reported with Middle East respiratory syndrome (
2
,
3
). A study reported a 75-year-old hospitalized woman with COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism (
4
). In addition, in 2 COVID-19-positive patients, 57 and 70 years of age, from Wuhan, China, computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed pulmonary embolism (
5
). Three cases of deep vein thrombosis with COVID-19 also have been reported (
6
).

Pregnancy increases the risk for venous embolism (
7
). Although approximately half of venous embolism occurs during pregnancy and half occurs during the postpartum period, the risk per day is greatest in the weeks immediately after delivery (
8
). We report a patient in Iran who sought care for cough and shoulder pain 5 days after an uncomplicated cesarean delivery in whom an acute pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 infection were subsequently diagnosed. The ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran) approved the study.

A healthy 36-year-old nonsmoking woman (gravid 2, 1 term infant delivered, 1 abortion/miscarriage) underwent an elective scheduled caesarean section at 37 weeks 2 days of gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The uncomplicated surgery resulted in the birth of a healthy infant. Mechanical prophylaxis to prevent deep vein thrombosis was used at delivery until ambulation. The woman was discharged on postpartum day 2 in a good condition. On postpartum day 5, she sought care for sudden onset left-side shoulder pain and dry cough. She stated that she did not have fever, myalgia, or diarrhea. On postpartum day 5, she experienced mild shortness of breath. During her pregnancy, she had no known history of contact with persons who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the patient's report of cough, she underwent screening for SARS-CoV-2. Throat swab samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Moreover, because of her clinical features, history, risk for venous embolism, and high level of D-dimer, CTA was performed. Thoracic CTA on the first day of hospitalization showed emboli in the right side interlobar artery, posterior basal segment, and the lingular branch (
Figure
, panels A, B). Hampton hump in the right side posterior basal segment was consistent with lung infarction. CTA further revealed left-sided pleural effusion associated with new mixed consolidation and ground glass opacifications (
Figure
, panels C, D).

CTA findings were consistent with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and lung infarction. The patient was treated with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg subcutaneously 2x/d). She was discharged in good condition with enoxaparin for 6 months.

Multiple conditions made this patient susceptible to pulmonary embolism. Because inflammation and coagulation are related, infected patients have hypercoagulable state (
2
). Virchow's triad, which contributes to thrombosis, has 3 factors: venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Septic patients have criteria of Virchow's triad; cesarean section as a surgery contributed to Virchow's triad in this patienet because endothelial injury made the patient prone to embolic events (
7
-
9
).

The patient we report was young, was not critically ill or septic, and had no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Alteration in coagulation pathways during pregnancy increases the risk for embolic events. The risk in the immediate postpartum period is particularly high. Venous embolism is an important cause of maternal illness and death (
7
).

CTA or ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis may be important for COVID-19-positive pregnant or postpartum patients who have signs or symptoms of possible venous embolism, given their potentially heightened risk. In this patient population, with an already elevated risk for venous embolism, physicians should be aware of the potential for concurrent mild COVID-19 and acute pulmonary embolism.

Given the increasing realization that COVID-19 might be associated with hypercoagulability, the concurrent presence of anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants should not be reassuring as preventive …","On April 3, a 74-year-old man with a history of multiple cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation treated with rivaroxaban (20 mg orally 1x/d), sought care for influenza-like illness and confusion. His work colleagues had noticed disorientation during his activity as a truck driver. At admission, physical examination revealed hypertension (230/70 mm Hg) and irregular heartbeat (86 beats/min). He was febrile (38.3degC) and had crackling sounds on pulmonary auscultation. Neurologic examination showed nonfluent aphasia. COVID-19 was diagnosed from results of real-time reverse transcription PCR, microbiologic testing, and computed tomographic thoracic imaging (
Appendix
). Brain computed tomographic scan revealed many recent ischemic infarctions in different vascular areas, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed this finding (
Figure
). As with patient 1, this patient had no non-central nervous system thrombotic events (e.g., pulmonary embolisms, abdominal visceral infarction). Treatment began with IV unfractionated heparin (18 UI/kg/h), hydroxychloroquine (200 mg orally 2x/d), and antimicrobial drugs (ceftriaxone 1g by IV infusion/d). The patient's aphasia regressed, and he was discharged on April 20.

Several factors can cause acute ischemic stroke, but the primary ones are arterial and cardiac embolism, arterial wall disease, and variants of those conditions. Both of these patients had concurrent cardiovascular conditions, particularly atrial fibrillation, although both were adequately treated with anticoagulants. Hematologic derangements, including lymphopenia and leukopenia, are associated with ischemic stroke and are predictors of worse prognosis with stroke (
7
). A systematic review and meta-analysis identified lymphopenia as one of the most prevalent laboratory results described in COVID-19 (35%-72%) (
8
), and we observed it in these 2 patients. Many infectious agents have been implicated as potential causes of cerebral stroke, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus,
Treponema pallidum
,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
, and
Aspergillus
spp.; acute bacterial meningitis has also been implicated (
9
). Multiple brain localizations have previously been described with other viruses that lead to cerebrovascular complications through various mechanisms, including multifocal vasculopathy, focal infiltrative vasculitis and vasospasm, and direct vessel wall invasion and thrombus formation (
10
).

In this rapidly emerging epidemic, several cases have reported strokes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (
1
-
6
). However, the unique feature in the patients we report is multiple simultaneous strokes. These cases involved presumed thrombotic stroke that occurred during ongoing anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis. Given the increasing realization that COVID-19 might be associated with hypercoagulability, the concurrent presence of anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants should not be reassuring as preventive.

Other authors suggest that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anticardiolipin antibodies, as well as anti-b
2
-glycoprotein I antibodies might rarely lead to multiple thrombotic cerebral events (
5
). In the patients we report, subsequent serologic testing showed anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM) in patient 1. We did not conduct functional testing (such as dilute Russell viper venom time). However, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in cases of stroke cannot be diagnosed until positive antibodies persist after multiple months.

The association between cerebral stroke and COVID-19 requires more attention. Coagulability dysfunction and possibly antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may contribute to thromboembolic events in the central nervous system. Further investigation is required to determine the prognostic role of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19.

This paper collates the pathological findings from initial published autopsy reports on 23 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 5 centers in the United States of America, including 3 cases from Houston, Texas. Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with a diffuse alveolar damage component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extravascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in nonhemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the 3 Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 g heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 g heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 g heart). All 3 subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65, and 35.2 Kg/m
2
). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy."

Abstract

Background

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) shows a global spreading trend. Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes is urgent needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19.

Methods

Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020 to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission, and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level.

Results

A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 ug/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer>=2.0 ug/ml, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 ug/ml on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization. Patients with D-dimer levels>=2.0 ug/ml had a higher incidence of mortality when comparing to those who with D-dimer levels < 2.0 ug/ml (12/67 vs 1/267, P<0.001, HR:51.5, 95%CI:12.9-206.7).

Conclusions

D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0ug/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been reduced drastically. In this review, we share our collective experiences regarding how we have changed our practice of medicine in response to the COVID surge. Although we review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on noninvasive measures and maximizing medical therapies. Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic. The role of multidisciplinary discussion, although always important, now has become critical. The support of our faculty and trainees remains essential. Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and by fostering trainee development through remote learning.

*

Endotracheal intubation is considered a high-risk procedure for aerosol-based transmission and should be performed cautiously.

*

In COVID-19 patients with phenotype 1, respiratory mechanics are consistent with high pulmonary compliance and severe hypoxemia, probably related to regional overperfusion and high shunting (corresponding to the ground-glass opacities). These patients may benefit from use of low to moderate PEEP to redistribute flow from damaged to undamaged areas of the lung and are likely to respond well to inhaled nitric oxide.

*

In phenotype 2, moderate to high PEEP as well as lateral and/or prone positioning may help recruit collapsed areas. Phenotype 3 resembles typical ARDS and should be managed as such. Finally, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism, regardless of phenotype.

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time. This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis."

Digital Ischemia in COVID-19 Patients: Case Report

As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause an immense burden on the global health care systems, it is crucial to understand the breadth of this disease process. Recent reports identified hypercoagulability in a subset of critically ill patients and extremity ischemia in an even smaller cohort. Because abnormal coagulation parameters and extremity ischemia have been shown to correlate with poor disease prognosis, understanding how to treat these patients is crucial. To better describe the identification and management of this phenomenon, we present 2 cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed fingertip ischemia while in the intensive care unit.

Patients with COVID-19 manifest a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The disease also affects multiple organ systems owing to uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in clinical presentations other than respiratory symptoms.

Skin is one of the organ systems involved in patients with COVID-19. Different cutaneous lesions have been increasingly associated with the disease in the literature; however, their prevalence and clinical value remain inconclusive. Regarding classification of cutaneous presentations, Galvan Casas et al categorized skin lesions of COVID-19 based on their clinical patterns into five types: (a) acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudochilblain); (b) other vesicular eruptions; (c) urticarial lesions; (d) maculopapular eruptions; and (e) livedo or necrosis.
2
Besides, Suchonwanit et al proposed that cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 may be classified into two major forms according to their pathomechanisms: (a) clinical features that indicate viral exanthems and (b) vasculopathy-related skin lesions, especially vasculitis and thrombotic vasculopathy.
3
Both clinical and pathophysiologic classifications may elucidate the diagnostic and prognostic values of cutaneous eruptions occurring in patients with COVID-19.

Exanthematous eruptions are commonly associated with viral infections. They are considered to be a hypersensitivity response to viral nucleotides.
4
Morbilliform eruptions, purpuric macules, petechial rash, urticaria, and varicella-like vesicles have been reported as COVID-19-associated exanthems in several articles.

6
However, none of the reported cases have so far revealed any correlation between the presence of exanthems and disease severity.

Vasculopathy-related skin manifestations have been reported in patients with ranging severities of COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that the multiple cytokines released could induce vasculitis and microangiopathy. Besides, activation of the coagulation cascade and complement-mediated microvascular injury seen in severe disease could result in a variety of coagulation disorder-associated skin manifestations.

3
The released cytokines, especially type I interferons and/or microthrombi might induce microangiopathic changes resulting in chilblain-like skin eruptions.
8
Considering that a majority of cases were asymptomatic or had mild clinical features, the presence of chilblain-like lesions might help diagnose asymptomatic patients and might indicate a good prognosis. In contrast, livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, acrocyanosis, and dry gangrene in critically ill patients with a systemic hypercoagulable state may indicate a poor prognosis.

We postulate that the degree of thromboembolism may correlate with the disease severity. Patients having mild disease with low-grade thrombosis might present with transient livedo reticularis, while those having severe disease with extensive thrombosis might present with livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, or limb ischemia.

Based on the current evidence, we may speculate that clinical features indicative of viral exanthems, including morbilliform, petechial, urticarial, and varicella-like skin lesions in patients with COVID-19, can be found in other diseases and therefore fail to provide specific clues for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19; however, vasculopathy-related skin manifestations, including chilblain-like lesions, vasculitis, livedo reticularis/racemosa, retiform purpura, acrocyanosis, and dry gangrene, may provide prognostic values by indicating serious complications due to COVID-19 and by monitoring disease severity. Early detection of cutaneous signs associated with severe disease is crucial to improve patient outcomes. However, there is still a lack of robust evidence to support this conclusion. Further studies regarding skin manifestations in COVID-19 are required to validate our hypothesis, which that may provide a useful clue to predict disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

A potential link between mortality, D-dimer values and a prothrombotic syndrome has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection.

This report summarizes evidence for thromboembolic disease, potential diagnostic and preventive actions as well as recommendations for patients with COVID-19 infection.

Introduction

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the globe since its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads from human to human primarily via aerosols from coughing or sneezing, but also via contaminated surfaces (
1
). SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by endocytosis after binding to the transmembrane angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein on cells in the lung, heart, blood vessels, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract (
2
). The diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nose, throat, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. The sensitivity of this test is suboptimal (50-80%), probably due to sampling error, low viral loads as well as timing of the sample in the disease course (
3
,
4
). In most COVID-19 patients, non-contrast chest CTscanning shows bilateral ground glass opacities with a peripheral and basal distribution. The sensitivity of CT-imaging, not specificity, may be higher than the standard nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR (
5
).

Clinicians worldwide face this new severe infectious lung disease with no proven therapies. Based on recent reports that demonstrated a strong association between elevated D-dimer levels and poor prognosis, concerns have risen about thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19.

The National Institute for Public Health of the Netherlands asked a group of Radiology and Vascular Medicine experts to provide guidance for the imaging workup and treatment of these important complications. We used a question answer format to provide an expert opinion on the imaging workup, prevention and treatment of possible thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19:

Evidence for embolic/ thromboembolic disease in COVID-19

Current literature on coagulation and thrombosis in COVID-19

Venous thromboembolism (VTE)

There are no publications on the prevalence or incidence of VTE (i.e. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE)) in patients with COVID-19. However, there are case reports on thromboembolic disease, stroke and myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 (
6
-
9
).

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

One Chinese single-center retrospective cohort study (Tongji hospital) of 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated DIC (
5
). According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition of DIC, 15 of 21 non-survivors (71%) were classified as having overtDIC (>=5 points) any time during follow-up, whereas only 1 of 162 survivors (0.6%) met these criteria (P<0.001). The median time from admission to DIC was 4 days (range, 2-12 days).

Thrombosis

Recent observations suggest that respiratory failure in COVID-19 is not driven by the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) alone (
10
), but that (microvascular) thrombotic processes may play a role as well. This may have important consequences for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of these patients. There is a strong association between D-dimer levels, disease progression and chest CT features suggesting venous thrombosis (
11
)(

Coagulation and COVID-19

The coagulation system can be activated by a variety of different viruses, including HIV, Dengue virus, and Ebola virus (
21
,
22
). During the relatively recent outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, which was associated with even higher morbidity and mortality than COVID-19, vascular endothelial damage in both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels was noted together with DIC, DVT and PE resulting in pulmonary infarction (
23
-
26
). A case report of an autopsy described thrombosis in multiple organs in a patient with proven SARS-CoV infection (
27
). Given the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, similar thrombotic complications are likely to be present in patients with COVID-19. Whether the coagulation cascade is directly activated by the virus or whether this is the result of local or systemic inflammation is not completely understood.

High plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-2, interleukin-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and tumor necrosis factor-a) have been observed in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. This is consistent with a ""cytokine storm"" with the secondary development of a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (
28
,
29
). While many pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger the coagulation system, Zhou and colleagues (
11
) showed that the increase in IL-6 was discrepant with the elevations in D-dimer; IL-6 levels appeared to increase only 13 days after disease onset, whereas D-dimer levels were already 10-fold increased by that time. This observation suggests that the very high D-dimer levels observed in COVID-19 patients are not only secondary to systemic inflammation, but also reflect true thrombotic disease, possibly induced by cellular activation that is triggered by the virus.

What diagnostic and preventive actions should be initiated?

Role of antithrombotic therapy

Notably, a Chinese single-center retrospective cohort study (Tonghi hospital) of 449 consecutive patients classified as having severe COVID-19 indicates that prophylactic doses of heparins might be associated with improved survival (20%) in patients with evidence of sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC)/DIC) (
30
). Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a respiratory rate >=30/min, arterial oxygen saturation <=93% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2 <=300 mmHg. Exclusion criteria included bleeding diathesis, hospital stay <7 days and lack of information of coagulation parameters and medications. Of the 449 patients, 99 (22%) received heparin for 7 days or longer (LMWH in 94 patients, usually enoxaparin 40-60 mg/day, and UFH in 5). Heparin was associated with lower 28-day mortality among the 97 patients with a SIC score >=4, (40% vs 64%; OR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15-0.90]; P=0.029), but not among the 352 patients with a SIC score <4 (29% vs 23%; P=0.42).

Chest CT

Several proposals have been made to enable standardized reporting, such as CO-RADS by the Dutch Radiological Society (
31
) and a consensus statement from the USA (
32
). Typical characteristics and time course of lung changes on chest CT were recently described (
33
). The CT severity score on initial scans is based on the amount of lung tissue (% lung parenchyma) that is involved at presentation (
34
). The common chest CT features have recently been enumerated from 1014 patients (
5
). Ground glass opacities (GGO) were found in all patients (100%) . The uniformity of GGOs in this disease was confirmed in 158 consecutive patients from Italy (
35
).

The typical CT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy was characterized by the consistent presence of peripheral ground glass opacities associated with multi-lobar and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (
Figure 2
). Vessel enlargement was described in the vicinity of areas with GGO, which is compatible with thrombo-inflammatory processes (
35
-
40
). Subsegmental vascular enlargement (more than 3 mm diameter) in areas of lung opacity was observed in 89% of patients with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia. All the CT's were done without contrast. Although in situ thrombosis is certainly a possibility, these findings could be due to hyperemia and increased blood flow (
Figure 2
) (
35
)

A recent retrospective study in 1008 patients, in which 25 patients underwent CT pulmonary angiography, demonstrated acute PE in 10 patients (40%), which were mainly located in subsegmental vessels (
7
). All patients were treated with anticoagulant therapy, and three demonstrated partial or complete resolution at follow-up CT pulmonary angiography, while two patients died (
7
).

Pulmonary thrombo-inflammatory processes, systemic-thrombosis and PE are currently poorly evaluated on chest CT examinations when iodinated intravenous contrast is not given (
41
).
Figure 3
demonstrates CT perfusion findings in early phase of the disease with multiple bilateral perfusion deficits due to microvascular obstruction. In the later stages of the illness, there are currently few clinical CT investigations with intravenous contrast in patients who become respiratory insufficient. In late phases of disease, it has been challenging to diagnose thromboembolic disease or complications. Importantly, this is a phase where plasma D-dimer may become extremely elevated in those with thrombo-inflammatory underlying pathophysiology (
Figure 4
) (
13
).

We conclude that careful attention needs to be paid to the initial diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the prothrombotic and thrombotic state that can occur in a substantial percentage of COVID-19 patients.

Prophylactic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all patients with (suspected) COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, irrespective of risk scores (e.g. Padua score).

A baseline (non-contrast) chest CT should be considered in all patients with suspected COVID-19 who have an indication for hospital admission (Dutch Healthcare).

In patients with suspected COVID-19 as well as a high clinical suspicion for PE (e.g. based on hemoptysis, unexplained tachycardia, or signs/symptoms of DVT, acute deterioration upon moving patient), CT pulmonary angiography should be considered if the D-dimer level is elevated. The D-dimer threshold used should follow locally used algorithms, i.e. >=500 mg/L, age-adjusted threshold, or >=1,000 mg/L when no YEARS criteria are present. If PE is confirmed, therapeutic anticoagulation is indicated.

In patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, routine D-dimer testing on admission and serially during hospital stay should be considered for prognostic stratification with additional imaging as available at local level (
Table 3
).

a. In patients with a D-dimer <1,000 ug/L on admission and no significant increase during follow-up, prophylactic anticoagulation should be continued.

b. In patients with a D-dimer <1,000 ug/L on admission but a significant increase during hospital stay to levels above 2,000-4,000 ug/L, imaging for DVT or PE should be considered, in particular when signs suggestive of clinically-relevant hypercoagulability such as venous congestion/thrombosis are present on chest CT, clotting of extracorporeal circuits, or when patients deteriorate clinically (e.g. refractory hypoxemia or unexplained new-onset tachycardia or hypotension). When imaging is not feasible, therapeutic-dose low-molecularweight heparin without imaging can be considered when the risk of bleeding is acceptable.

c. For patients with D-dimer values between 1,000 and 2,000 ug/L, there is no clear-cut guidance other than institution of prophylactic anticoagulation. These patients may suffer from venous thromboembolism, and where possible this should be excluded. Close monitoring of D-dimer in combination with clinical findings should lead to further decision making along the lines of low vs strongly increased D-dimer levels.

d. In patients with a strongly increased D-dimer on admission (e.g. 2,000-4,000 ug/L), caution is warranted. D-dimer testing should be repeated within 24-48 hours to detect further increases in which case imaging for DVT or PE should be considered as outlined above.

Backgound

To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied. Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.

Results

We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation-related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (
P
< .01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.

Conclusions

Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the end of 2019, a newly identified illness termed COVID-19 has spread rapidly through China and the rest of the world. A novel beta-coronavirus, known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the COVID-19 pathogen, which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, even lethal, lung failure.
1
By 2 March 2020, the virus had caused 80 303 confirmed cases and 2948 deaths in China and cases have been reported in 45 countries, including the United States, Korea, Japan and Italy. In the existing cases, some patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and a part of them worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
1

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein).
2
A recent study suggests that the affinity between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that with the RBD of SARS-CoV, indicating that ACE2 might also be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
3
ACE2 was reported to be widely expressed in various organ systems including the cardiovascular system, kidneys, lungs and brain,
4
,
5
which might provide an explanation for why some COVID-19 patients died of multiple organ failure.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide and is anticipated to rise substantially over the next decades.
6
Several investigations have demonstrated a higher susceptibility to some infectious diseases in diabetic people, like
Staphylococcus aureus
and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
,
7
-
9
probably owing to the dysregulated immune system.
10
It has reported that plasma glucose levels and diabetes are independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS.
11
A retrospective study in Wuhan, China revealed that of the 41 COVID-19 patients, 32% of them had underlying diseases, and among which 20% was diabetes.
12
Therefore, these diabetic patients might be at increased risk of COVID-19 and have a poorer prognosis.

To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor to influence the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, 174 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from 10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020 were included in this study according to the inclusion criteria. Their basic information, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT) scans as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed. We found that, as a common underlying disease in COVID-19 patients, diabetes is associated with worse prognosis.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This was a retrospective study of 174 patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection who were admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from 10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020. The enrolled patients in this study are all diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance. Wuhan Union Hospital is a designated hospital for treating COVID-19. In the first part, we divided all patients into two groups based on whether they had diabetes. In the second part, we excluded patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of other comorbidities, and then the patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes were separated into two groups. This case series was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for the emerging infectious diseases.

We extracted demographic data, medical history, exposure history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, and the treatment measures from electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom showed up. Clinical outcomes were followed up to 3 March 2020. All data were analysed by the research team and double checked by two physicians (Y.S. and L.Z.).

Laboratory validation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at Wuhan Union Hospital. Throat-swab specimens that obtained from the upper respiratory tract of patients at admission were stored in viral-transport medium. Total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China). SARS-CoV-2 was examined by RT-PCR as described previously.
12

All COVID-19 patients met the following criteria: (a) Epidemiology history, (b) Fever or other respiratory symptoms, (c) Typical CT image abnormities of viral pneumonia, and (d) Positive result of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Patients were divided into the diabetes and non-diabetes group according to their medical history. Furthermore, CT imaging scores were used to quantify the pathological changes of COVID-19 patients. The values were obtained by two physicians, who were blinded to the patients' clinical data, using an introduced scoring system described as below.

3 RESULTS

Of 174 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 59 years (interquartile range, 49-67) and 76 (43.7%) were men. For the all patients the most common symptoms were fever (78.2%), chill (68.4%), cough (32.2%), fatigue (27%), chest tightness (25.9%), shortness of breath (24.1%) and myalgia (20.7%), whereas nausea (9.8%), headache (6.9%), pharyngalgia (5.2%) and chest pain (8.6%) were relatively rare. The most common of underlying comorbidities were chronic diseases, such as hypertension (24.7%) and diabetes (21.2%). Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes had more cardiovascular disease (32.4% vs 14.6%) and less fever (59.5% vs 83.2%), but had no significant differences in gender and age, as well as mortality (Table
1
).

Since our purpose is to explore whether diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, we next excluded patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of other comorbidities on the results. Our findings are as follows. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older (61 [IQR, 57-69] vs 32 [IQR, 30-37]), had more nausea and vomiting (16.7% vs 0%) and higher mortality(16.7% vs 0%), but had no significant differences in gender and other baseline symptoms, follow-up time, as well as the time from onset of symptom to hospital admission between the two groups (Table
3
).

On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. The prominent radiologic abnormalities were bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation, which is consistent with other recent reports.

The representative chest CT imaging of patients with or without diabetes were compared, and the latter showed more severe pathological changes than the former (Figure
1A
). Furthermore, the severity of pathological changes was evaluated by the quantifiable score system described before. We found that the diabetes group presented higher CT imaging score compared with non-diabetes group (Figure

Further, we analysed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pathology of diabetes. We found that patients with diabetes control blood glucose levels with insulin or oral medicine before admission. Among them, 29.2% of the patients took insulin before and increased the dose of insulin after admission, and 37.5% of the patients took oral medicine before admission and started insulin therapy after admission, which meant that patients had poor glycemic control during hospitalization. Of all the diabetic patients, only three had diabetic complications, and those patients with diabetic complications were more likely to die as shown in Table
5
.

Finally, we explored the impact of comorbidities on the prognosis of patients with diabetes. Through our analysis, although the indicators for diabetic patients with other comorbidities are slightly higher than those without other comorbidities, no matter evaluated from organ damage, inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability, other comorbidities have little effect on the prognosis of patients with diabetes (Table
S2
).

4 DISCUSSION

Common perceptions associate diabetes with a generally increased mortality and morbidity to infectious diseases, although epidemiologic data that would prove this are surprisingly scarce. However, it seems to be confirmed that diabetes predisposes to certain types of infection and death,
6
-
9
,
11
but it is still unknown whether diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of COVID-19. Type 2 diabetes is widely viewed as a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease caused by long-term immune system imbalance, metabolic syndrome or nutrient excess associated with obesity.
14
,
15
Obesity-associated inflammation is characterized by an increased abundance and activation of innate and adaptive immunity cells in adipose tissue along with an increased release of inflammatory factors and chemokines locally and systemically.
16
On the other side, data from human and animal studies suggest that some viruses are diabetogenic.
17
Jali et al
18
reported two individuals presenting with acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for a brief and transient period after being infected with chicken pox. And in a study of SARS, Yang et al
11
found that even in non-severe patients who have not been treated with glucocorticoid drugs, their fasting blood glucose levels are higher. Another study found that the immunostaining of ACE2 protein is strong in islets, but weak in exocrine tissues which means coronavirus might cause diabetes by damaging islets seriously.
19
Since viral infection may cause sharp fluctuation of blood glucose level of diabetes patients, which adversely affect the recovery of patients, there is a reason to suspect that diabetes combined with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia may form a vicious circle, which is detrimental to the prognosis of COVID-19.

Reports showed that ICU patients, non-ICU patients and recovery patients differ in CT imaging results, which means CT results can be used as one of the indicator for determining the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
20
According to the quantifiable score, we found that the diabetes group presented higher CT imaging score compared with non-diabetes group, which means pneumonia in diabetic patients is more severe than non-diabetic patients.

In addition to imaging results, laboratory results also give us some hints. Biochemical results showed that some indicative enzymes were abnormally elevated in the blood of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, including LDH, HBDH, ALT and GGT, which indicated the injury of myocardium, kidney and liver. This result is consistent with the extensive distribution of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2,
5
and can also partially explain why some patients died from multiple organ failure.
1
It is important to note that the levels of these enzymes were even higher in patients with diabetes when compared to patients without diabetes, which give us a clue that the injure of organs was much more serious in diabetes patients group than those without diabetes. In addition, our study found that the levels of total protein, albumin, prealbumin and haemoglobin are significantly lower in patients with diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes, which means diabetes patients are more likely to be undernourished.

According to a recent report, after analysing 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, they found that neutrophilia related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation related to sustained inflammatory response and acute kidney injury related to direct effects of the virus might be associated with the death of patients with COVID-19.
12
And other study also found that patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially those with severe pneumonia, have significantly reduced lymphocyte counts and significantly increased inflammatory factors, such as IL-6.
20
In fact, in the advanced stage of SARS and Ebola virus infections, cytokine storms are also the main cause of eventual death for many patients. In our study, we found that, compared to patients without diabetes, absolute count of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with diabetes is significantly lower, while the absolute count of neutrophils is remarkably higher. Furthermore, the serum levels of some inflammation-related biomarker are much higher compared to those without diabetes, such as IL-6, serum ferritin, ESR and CRP. It's noteworthy that for diseases that can induce a cytokine storm. IL-6 is a very good predictor of disease severity and prognosis, and its expression time is longer than other cytokines (TNF and IL-1).
21
In addition, a significant rise in serum ferritin indicates the activation of the monocyte-macrophage system, which is a crucial part of inflammatory storm. These results indicate that patients with diabetes are susceptible to form an inflammatory storm, which eventually lead to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.

During the inflammatory storm, the D-dimer increases significantly. In the early stage, this is the result of inflammation activating plasmin. However, as inflammation progresses and the presence of hypoxia, hypoxia-induced molecules can activate thrombin directly, and the activation of monocyte-macrophages would also secrete a mass of tissue factors and activate the exogenous coagulation pathway, which lead to an overall hypercoagulable state or even disseminated intravascular coagulation. In our study, we found that level of D-dimer and FIB was significantly higher in patients with diabetes, which indicate that they are more prone to a hypercoagulable state than patients without diabetes.

Clinical medication showed that the insulin dose increased after the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2, which shows that the virus has an impact on the patient's glucose metabolism. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism will aggravate diabetes and then affect the severity of pneumonia, which works as an amplification loop. Meanwhile, the diabetic complications signify the severity of diabetes, and these patients with diabetic complications showed a higher mortality rate, which further proves that diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of COVID-19, and the severity of diabetes is positively correlated with the poor prognosis.

All in all, whether interference from other comorbidities is present or not, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients with diabetes are more severe than those without diabetes evaluating from organ damage, inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability, and are more likely to progress into a worse prognosis. Therefore, diabetes might could be considered as a risk factor for the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and more intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.

Abstract

Patients with diabetes who get coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of a severe disease course and mortality. Several factors especially the impaired immune response, heightened inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state contribute to the increased disease severity. However, there are many contentious issues about which the evidence is rather limited. There are some theoretical concerns about the effects of different anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. Similarly, despite the recognition of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), and the role of ACE2 in lung injury; there are conflicting results with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in these patients. Management of patients with diabetes in times of restrictions on mobility poses some challenges and novel approaches like telemedicine can be useful. There is a need to further study the natural course of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes and to understand the individual, regional and ethnic variations in disease prevalence and course.

Background

The high prevalence of diabetes globally makes it a frequent comorbidity in patients with coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-19). Though diabetes increases the risk of infection in general, most studies have reported prevalence of diabetes almost similar to that in general population in patients with COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eight trials in China showed that diabetes was present in 8% of 46,248 patients with COVID-19 [
1
]. Understandably, prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 varies by region, age and ethnicity. It is not known whether patients with diabetes with well-controlled blood glucose levels have an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2).

Why patients with diabetes have increased severity and mortality?

Patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 have been seen to have a worse prognosis and increased mortality in most studies. In 201 Chinese patients with diabetes a hazard ratio of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.35-4.05;
p
= 0.002) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
2
] has been reported. Further, meta-analysis of nine studies from China (
n
= 1936) showed a significant correlation between severity of COVID-19 and diabetes (OR, 2.67, 95% CI; 1.91-3.74;
p
< 0.01) [
3
]. Similarly, case fatality rate was 7.3% in patients with diabetes as opposed to 2.3% in those without diabetes in a report of 44,672 patients of COVID-19 by Chinese Centre for Disease Control [
4
]. A recent study in 1122 patients with COVID-19 in 88 centres across the USA found diabetes to be associated with more than fourfold increase in mortality [
5
].

How diabetes increases severity of COVID-19 is unclear, though several factors may be responsible (Table
1
). Poor glycaemic control impairs several aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections and to the potential secondary bacterial infection in the lungs [
6
,
7
]. Defects in immunity namely inappropriate T-cell action, impaired natural killer cell activity and defects in complement action could reduce viral clearance [
8
]. Interestingly, ARDS in patients with COVID-19 is driven by severe hypoxaemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the cytokine storm, which is believed to be responsible for ARDS as well as multi-organ dysfunction in COVID-19 [
9
]. In this context, it is important to note that there is strong association between type 2 diabetes, obesity and abnormal secretion of adipokines and cytokines like TNF-alfa and interferon, which may further impair immunity and predispose to severe infection [
10
]. Further, diabetes is associated with increased plasminogen levels which has been postulated to increase the virulence of SARS CoV-2 [
11
]. Presence of these inflammation and prothrombotic factors has been shown in a study in 174 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China; significantly higher serum levels of interleukein 6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen and D-dimer were reported in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes [
12
]. Increased viral replication in diabetes may also due to an increase in furin, which is a type-1 membrane-bound protease involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell [
13
]. In addition, pre-existing comorbidities associated with diabetes like hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease further worsen the prognosis. Lastly, hypoglycaemia which could occur during treatment of diabetes may additionally worsen the clinical outcomes.

Table 1 Reasons of increased severity of COVID-19 in diabetes based on various studies (mostly unadjusted analyses).

In this respect role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is intriguing. SARS CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to ACE2, a process which involves many steps and several enzymes and proteins [
14
]. There is experimental evidence for downregulation of ACE2 in diabetes [
15
], which may predispose to more severe lung injury. On the other hand, ACE2 is a receptor for SARS CoV-2 and this downregulation might reduce the entry of virus into cells. These issues are further discussed below in context of use of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive drugs.

Anti-hyperglycaemic drugs: correct selection and potential problems

The precise effect of treatment with various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents on the severity of COVID-19 is not known, though there are some theoretical considerations. Metformin has shown modest benefits in lower respiratory tract infections and pulmonary tuberculosis [
16
], though gastrointestinal tolerability in sick patients is of concern. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase ACE2 levels [
17
]. However, propensity of thiazolidinediones to cause fluid retention and the risk of congestive heart failure in COVID-19 would make these agents unfavourable for treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have has been shown to increase ACE2 and increase surfactant in experimental animals [
18
]. Practical significance of changes in ACE2 levels with use of thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists is not known. Sulfonylureas are effective, but the risk of hypoglycaemia especially in the setting of irregular meals might preclude their use. Nevertheless, sulfonylureas can be considered whenever blood glucose monitoring is possible.

There is some data regarding use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors from previous viral epidemics. DPP4 is the prime receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus responsible for its entry into cell [
19
]. Hence the possibility of DPP4 facilitating the entry of SARS CoV-2 into the cell cannot be ruled out. In that context, it is an interesting postulation that widespread use of DPP4 inhibitors in India and many other countries might be protecting individuals with diabetes from this infection. On the other hand, DPP4 inhibitors can potentially interfere with immune response which may be harmful, but clinical data from DPP4 inhibitors has shown that this is generally not the case [
20
].

There is increasing use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors worldwide and in India. Interestingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could also activate ACE2 indirectly especially if used along with ACE inhibitors [
21
]. There is a hypothetical possibility of SGLT-2 inhibitors reducing lactate production because of reduction in oxygen demand of tissues, which could reduce viral entry by raising cytosolic pH [
22
]. Further, caution about dehydration and the possibility of euglycaemic ketoacidosis need to be observed when using SGLT-2 inhibitors in sick patients with COVID-19. Insulin has also been shown to increase ACE2 expression by attenuating the effect of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM-17) [
23
]. Practical relevance of these findings is not known at present. In any case, insulin remains the agent of choice to control sugars in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. This however necessitates frequent monitoring of blood glucose and poses some practical concerns in terms of increasing the exposure of healthcare provider to the COVID-19 patient. Strategies like single dose of basal insulin and self-monitoring of glucose by patients are worth considering in that context. Further, technologies like remote continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump could be useful.

Thus, it appears safe to continue the usual anti-hyperglycemic medications in most patients who have mild infection, good general condition and normal oral intake. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors might need discontinuation due to the risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis. Metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake. Doses of other anti-hyperglyacemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levels. Hospitalised patients especially those requiring intensive care would need insulin for glycaemic control.

Drugs for treatment of comorbidities in diabetes

These are commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes, especially in those with hypertension and kidney dysfunction. There have been a lot of literature and debate whether these drugs could benefit or harm patients having COVID-19 infection. This issue is discussed below.

Scientific experimental data that support potential harm duet to ACE inhibitors/ARB in COVID-19

There has been a lot of interest in ACE inhibitors and ARBs following the identification of ACE2 as the receptor for SARS CoV-2. ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the levels of ACE2 by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2. Increased ACE2 expression could theoretically increase viral binding and entry into cell, though there is no clinical evidence to support this otherwise attractive hypothesis. Reduced angiotensin 2 as a result of ACE inhibition and increased angiotensin 1-7 as a result of increased activity of ACE2 could reduce the cytosolic pH, which could result in more favourable environment for viral endocytosis [
24
]. Also, angiotensin 1-7 has been shown to increase sympathetic activity by acting on Mas receptors in the brainstem, which could contribute to cardiovascular morbidity observed in these patients [
25
]. However, most of these concerns are hypothetical with minimal evidence.

Scientific experimental data that support benefit due to ACE inhibitors/ARB in COVID-19

Increased ACE2 might not result in increased viral entry because of the limited availability of the serine protease TMPRSS2, which is required for viral binding [
20
]. Increased ACE2 and consequently angiotensin 1-7 have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects and have been shown to be protective against lung injury in animals [
26
]. Treatment with ARBs was reported to reduce mortality in Ebola virus infection [
27
]. Previously, a small study in ten patients with ARDS showed that recombinant ACE2 was well tolerated and led to an increase in angiotensin (1-7) levels [
28
].

Clinical studies with ACE inhibitors/ARBs in COVID-19

(1)

There are no controlled studies on the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19.

(2)

The clinical evidence is inconclusive. While one study in China did not find any association of ACE inhibitor use with severity of disease, there was an increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving ACE inhibitors and ARBs in another study [
29
,
30
]. One study in the USA did not find any significant difference in mortality in patients who received ACE inhibitors and ARBs and those who did not [
31
]. A recently published study in 1128 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in nine hospitals in Hubei, China showed significantly reduced all-cause mortality with the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with other anti-hypertensive drugs [
32
].

(3)

Many patients with COVID-19 have shown hypokalemia indicating activation of RAS [
33
], and ACE inhibitors and ARBs may have a role [
34
].

In this subject situation is far from clear and there are too many unknown factors, which might be operative in the interaction between ACE2, diabetes, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and lung injury. The lack of evidence for either benefit or harm has prompted European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension, European Society of Hypertension and American Heart Association to advise continuing with ACE inhibitors and ARBs in case a patient develops COVID-19 [
35
]. A clinical trial is underway to study the ARB losartan and recombinant human ACE2 in patients with COVID-19.

Unanswered questions

There have been several commentaries on the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 [
36
]. However, several unanswered questions remain, about which the knowledge and information is limited. Clearly, further research could lead to important insights (Table
2
). Some of these are discussed below.

(1)

What is the natural history of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes? The natural course of the disease after infection of patients with diabetes with SARS CoV-2 has not been documented well. For example, we don't know if the incubation period is different in people with diabetes. It is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young, have short duration of diabetes, and well controlled may have less severe COVID-19 infection. There is a possibility of reduced viral clearance in diabetes as has been reported in patients who are on corticosteroids [
37
]. This could have public health implications as the patients with diabetes could remain infectious for a longer period than those without diabetes.

(2)

Use of drugs in treatment of COVID-19 which could have effect on glycaemia:

a.

Chloroquine has also been licensed for use in India for patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the efficacy of chloroquine is not proven; it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [
38
]. Chloroquine has a weak anti-hyperglycaemic effect and there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic drugs.

b.

Corticosteroids, though neither effective nor recommended, are frequently used in ARDS and sepsis and would worsen glycemic levels.

(3)

COVID-19 and pancreatic beta cells: there is significant expression of ACE2 receptors in pancreatic islets and hyperglycaemia lasting up to 3 years has been reported in patients with SARS [
39
]. Direct injury to beta cells is a possibility and patients recovering from COVID-19 might need major changes in anti-hyperglycaemic regimen. Recently, new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients with COVID-19 [
11
].

(4)

Suboptimal lifestyle measures and other issues during lockdown:

a.

There are restrictions on movement of people and 'lockdowns' in several parts of the world in order to contain the pandemic. This poses some challenges in the evaluation and treatment of patients with diabetes. There are limited opportunities for exercise as regular walks and visits to gyms or swimming pools are not possible. Dietary irregularity could occur because of staying at home.

b.

There is considerable mental stress because of the unpredictability of the disease as well as social immobility as brought out in an excellent study in healthy people in China at the time when there was a huge burden of COVID-19 there [
40
].

c.

Patients may find it difficult to procure healthy foods, medicines, insulin, needles and glucose strips etc. because of partial or complete lockdowns. The problem becomes more pronounced with elderly, poor and disadvantaged sections of society.

d.

There could be underreporting of symptoms because of the perceived need to avoid visiting hospitals.

All these factors could cause glucose dysregulation and could predispose patients to complications like infections, hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis and even acute cardiac events. A prediction model of the effect of lockdown in India on blood glucose showed a 3.6% increase in HbA1c at the end of 45 days of lockdown and future increase in diabetes-related complications [
41
].

(5)

Use of remote education and advice: Telemedicine (also emails, texts) can be very helpful in these times to impart education and has been shown to improve glycaemia. Telemedicine guidelines for physicians in India have been published [
42
]. Patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting, drowsiness, shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness of limbs, altered sensorium, etc [
43
].

(6)

COVID-19 testing for all patients with diabetes? Given the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes, a case could be made for testing of all people with diabetes for the presence of disease. That would be a humongous task considering the high prevalence of diabetes. High-risk groups like those with high HbA1c, those with comorbidities, long duration of diabetes or elderly could be chosen for testing, however, utility of this approach remains to be proven, There are frequent false negative tests and repeated testing may be required in asymptomatic individuals. Since there is no treatment currently recommended for asymptomatic people, therefore apart from isolating them, detecting these patients might not prove meaningful clinically.

(7)

Ethnic variations in severity of COVI19 in patients with diabetes? In the United States, the disease has caused disproportionately more fatalities in Blacks and Asians compared with Whites [
44
]. South Asia, Africa and Korea have seen much lower mortality than rest of the world. Whether it is because of the different approaches topublic health measures, innate immunity or due to some ethnicity-specific variability in response to viral infection, or availability of good medical resources, remains to be studied. Interactions between ethnicity, diabetes and severity of COVID-19 will be of interest, considering the racial disparities in the prevalence of diabetes. According to a recent report, prevalence of COVID-19 and mortality due to the disease correlated significantly with frequency of D allele in ACE gene [
45
]. Such polymorphisms in ACE gene as well as several other genes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 might be responsible for individual and ethnic variations in disease course.

(8)

Benefits of lockdown? There could be some positive effects of the social restrictions.

a.

Patients have more time for self-care and could pay more attention to diet and exercise if motivated.

b.

Some people have stopped or reduced alcohol and smoking because of non-availability.

c.

There has been significant fall in air pollution as a result of reduced industrial and vehicular emissions [
46
]. Increase in blood glucose has been reported with short-term rise in pm
10
(particulate matter <10 microns in diameter) and glycaemic improvement could occur with the fall in pollution [
47
].

In view of the issues highlighted above, it is important to recognise the importance of diabetes as a vital comorbidity in patients with COVID-19. There are several contentious issues and the ongoing research will hopefully shed more light on the behaviour of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.

ABSTRACT

Real-world drug repurposing--the immediate ""off-label"" prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs--is a widely overlooked opportunity. Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our health care systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.

KEYWORDS

December 2019 heralded the transformation of modern-day life. A new and lethal disease, now named COVID-19, was emerging in China and was about to change the world as we know it. The same month, in propitious timing, a few hundred of the world's leading physicians, scientists, government agency officials, and nonprofit leaders gathered at an inaugural 2-day conference jointly sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Washington, DC. The topic of the conference was ""Repurposing Off-Patent Drugs,"" and attendees had convened to discuss how widely used, low-cost, and safe medicines that are approved for one indication might be harnessed to provide additional, novel, and sometimes unexpected therapeutic benefits in other diseases.

Dr Christopher Austin, Director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the NIH, opened the conference by welcoming the birth of a new era in human medicine. He asked participants ""to skewer some sacred cows,"" emphasizing the need to embrace controversial thinking to improve patients' lives.

Drug repurposing seems tantalizingly simple. Conservatively, there are 6,500 human diseases that have no regulatory-approved treatments whatsoever. At the current rate of progress, it will be 2,000 years before every human disease is treatable. What percentage of those 6,500 currently untreatable diseases is ameliorable, to some degree, by a drug you can get at [your local pharmacy]? Shame on us if we can't figure out a way to make these available to patients suffering from disabling and lethal diseases. This is an eminently solvable problem.

If drug repurposing was an obscure subject for experts as well as the public, COVID-19 has changed that forever. The publicity generated by the US president endorsing the antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as treatments for COVID-19 jolted regulatory authorities worldwide. The FDA felt compelled to grant emergency-use authorization for these drugs, while the European Medicines Agency held back, urging that they should not be prescribed outside of clinical trials and nationally agreed upon protocols. In the absence of proven treatments, many physicians at the frontlines of the COVID-19 battle prescribed these drugs, resulting in a worldwide shortage. Conflicting clinical trial data have emerged since then regarding use of these antimalarial drugs in COVID-19 [
1
-
7
], some of which indicate a lack of benefit or even the potential for harm [
6
]. This underscores the need for emergency regulatory authorization of unproven treatments, if deemed necessary in a public health crisis, to be based first and foremost on robust evidence of safety. It is also important that the relevant agency issues a statement emphasizing the exploratory nature of the intervention and urgent need for robust clinical trial data to support ongoing use.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were developed as antimalarial treatments and subsequently repurposed for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Their repurposing for these challenging autoimmune diseases was facilitated by funding from pharmaceutical companies, which recouped their investment through patent-protected revenues until the drugs became available as generics. However, only a small proportion of drug-repurposing discoveries enjoy patent protection and can benefit from the large and costly clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval.

By contrast, real-world repurposing--the immediate ""off-label"" prescribing of drugs by caring physicians based on their acumen, awareness of pilot studies or case reports, or field experience in the clinical setting--is a widely overlooked opportunity. Prescribing a drug off-label (ie, for a use other than what it was approved for) is legal in almost every country worldwide. However, if there is an unforeseen adverse outcome, the burden of liability shifts from the regulator or pharmaceutical company to the prescribing physician. Additionally, the burden of payment shifts from the insurer or other institutional health care payers to the patient. Nevertheless, when dealing with immediate and urgent health crises, whether at an individual or public level, real-world repurposing is frequently the only realistic solution.

To protect the public from unscrupulous players, the US FDA prohibits pharmaceutical companies from promoting off-label uses of their drugs, which could be used to increase profit while avoiding investment in clinical trials. By contrast, the FDA is supportive of disseminating information about promising off-label uses by independent entities, a point reiterated in March 2020 on the FDA's website [
8
]. This underscores the importance of vigorous efforts to create reliable, independent evidentiary repositories to disseminate such treatment opportunities, and thereby support the decision making of those in the frontlines, in nearly real time.

Two additional critical elements are prerequisites if real-world repurposing is to deliver health benefits at the public level: safety and affordability. The former calls for a decades-long track record of established safety, and the latter requires the availability of generic low-cost drug candidates. Fortunately, many thousands of such drugs are already available. The challenge is that no central repository of off-label uses exists in a way that enables immediate intervention in times of public health crises.

Taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we have selected four well-established drugs backed by many decades of safety data, widespread use, and affordability, which we believe offer the opportunity to prevent or treat both the viral infection and the disabling and deadly complications that ensue. Although COVID-19 usually presents with respiratory symptoms, infection that spreads beyond the lung contributes significantly to the disease toll through uncontrolled outpouring of immune cells, disturbed clotting, multi-organ failure, and other life-threatening complications. There is extensive clinical support, backed by a solid mechanistic scientific rationale, underpinning the proposed drugs (
Multimedia Appendix 1
). Each was selected based on safety, affordability, and ability to target multiple aspects of the underlying disease processes that make COVID-19 so deadly. The proposed doses are those that have been shown to achieve the target physiological effects as demonstrated in the supporting references.

Cimetidine and famotidine, which are approved for heartburn caused by reflux disease [
9
], have been shown to have powerful effects on the immune system [
10
]. Data indicate that they can suppress a wide variety of common viruses, including herpes and human papillomaviruses [
11
-
13
], and boost immune response after vaccination [
14
-
20
], with additional immune-modulating effects in a range of cancers and allergic diseases [
10
]. They have also shown efficacy in protecting the heart from excessive workload, lowering blood pressure, and improving cardiac efficiency [
21
,
22
]; reducing inflammation [
23
]; and inhibiting pathological blood clotting [
24
,
25
]. A clinical trial of famotidine in COVID-19 was started recently in New York, following the observation (as yet unpublished) that certain patients in China who were taking it when diagnosed with COVID-19 had better clinical outcomes than those who were not [
26
]. Data generated from this new study are eagerly awaited.

The cholesterol-lowering agents fenofibrate and bezafibrate are approved for treatment of dyslipidemias [
41
]. Although bezafibrate is unavailable in the United States, it is widely used in Europe. Meta-analyses show that they can reduce disability and death from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and stroke, independent from their effects on cholesterol [
42
,
43
]. Potentially protective effects on kidney function have been reported [
44
,
45
], along with antiviral efficacy in patients with a hepatitis C virus infection [
46
]. In some patients, fibrates have lowered plasma fibrinogen levels to a statistically significant degree [
47
-
52
], suggesting the potential to address the dangerous hypercoagulability seen in many patients with COVID-19. Indeed, fibrates have demonstrated anticoagulant and cardiovascular protective effects in patients with metabolic syndrome [

], which represents a hypercoagulable state accompanied by inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

The phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor sildenafil citrate is a vasodilator that was approved in 1998 for treating erectile dysfunction [
54
] and more recently received an indication for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [
55
]. Sildenafil has a wide range of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory actions across many body systems, with benefits reported in case studies of patients with type 2 diabetes [
56
,
57
] and hematological cancers [
58
]. Reported cardioprotective effects, stemming from improved pulmonary circulation as well as direct action on the myocardium [
59
], include improved cardiac contractility and reduced symptoms in patients with a range of cardiac disorders [
60
-
62
], with reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at high risk [
63
]. Studies demonstrating sildenafil's efficacy and tolerability in PAH continue to accrue, and a recent Cochrane review and meta-analysis concluded that patients with PAH who received PDE-5 inhibitors were significantly less likely to die in the short-term than those receiving a placebo [
64
]. Sildenafil may also reduce mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [
65
], an interstitial lung disease with high mortality, and preliminary evidence suggests that this drug class is actively renoprotective [
62
,
66
]. Sildenafil is currently under investigation in a phase 3 trial in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04304313), which will help clarify its therapeutic potential.

Times of emergency, such as with the COVID-19 pandemic, call for a radical review of the way we practice medicine. As Dr Austin aptly stated, we have to be ready ""to skewer some sacred cows."" Clinical trials of unprofitable generic drugs sponsored by governments or nonprofit organizations are obviously welcome and important but should not delay the judicious use of well-established, safe, cost-effective, and rationally prescribed therapies.

The race to find a cure for COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented worldwide research efforts. As of the time of writing, the Milken Foundation has compiled a list of treatments being studied for COVID-19 [
67
]. Nevertheless, the time to approval and the expected high cost of the majority of these drugs may leave them out of reach for a large portion of the world's population.

The four well-established drugs presented here for consideration, alone or in combination, for at-risk patients with COVID-19 highlight the gems buried in the mountain of hundreds of thousands of clinical studies, inaccessible to physicians battling at the frontlines of clinical medicine. Unbeknownst to most of them, the four drugs selected in this case, officially approved for a handful of indications, have shown efficacy in managing over 100 additional diseases. We do not propose specifically when or how each of these drugs should be used; rather, we aim to provide a pathophysiological rationale for their use, alone or in combination; share our understanding of why and how they may provide benefit; and spur creative thinking about their potential use in this disease while illustrating the untapped potential of therapeutic options that may be hidden in plain sight.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unparalleled opportunity to refocus our efforts on mining, synthesizing, and cataloging the body of evidence behind many promising treatment opportunities. This article is an invitation to kindred spirits and curious, bold humanitarians to pool efforts to harness this opportunity to future-proof our health care systems based on robust science. We owe it to ourselves and future generations.

COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability and a prothrombotic state.

*

Little is understood about the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in mild disease.

We present a case of mild COVID-19 complicated by extensive deep venous thrombosis.

To the Editor

A 48-year-old non-smoker male with a history of coronary artery disease and non-heart-beating renal donation secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis was admitted to the medicine service with subjective fevers, myalgias, non-productive cough and dyspnea for two weeks. He denied recent travel or exposure to persons with known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He had a temperature of 38.9C (102.1F), blood pressure of 187/110 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a surgical scar in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Laboratory testing on admission was notable for leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein and D-dimer (
Table 1
). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 infection was positive. Chest x-ray demonstrated small patchy opacities in the mid-left lung field and electrocardiogram was remarkable for normal sinus rhythm with a QTc interval of 449 milliseconds. He was started on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, as well as azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia. He received enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. His symptoms improved, he did not require supplemental oxygen, and was discharged on hospital day two.

He presented to the emergency room (ER) three days later with difficulty bearing weight on his right leg. Laboratory testing did not reveal significant changes from prior admission. He had normal range of motion, the leg did not appear erythematous or swollen on physical examination and he was discharged from the ER. The possibility of a deep venous thrombosis was not considered. Approximately two weeks after initial hospital admission, he returned to the ER with worsening right leg pain, erythema, and edema. Pain was sharp in nature, exacerbated by movement, ten out of ten on the numeric pain scale. Acetaminophen did not ameliorate the pain. He was afebrile and saturating 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for erythema of the right leg from mid-calf to thigh and tenderness to palpation. Distal pulses were intact. He was found to have an elevated D-dimer, and COVID-19 PCR was positive again (
Table 1
). Repeat chest x-ray was remarkable for worsening bilateral opacities. Duplex ultrasound of the right leg demonstrated an acute partially occlusive deep vein thrombosis within the common femoral and popliteal veins and acute occlusive clot in the gastrocnemius vein (
Fig. 1
). He was started on therapeutic apixaban and IV vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for possible overlying cellulitis. Further coagulation studies revealed a normal fibrinogen (313 mg/dL), and negative beta glycoprotein IgM/IgG, cardiolipin IgM/IgG and lupus anticoagulant. Erythema and pain improved, and he was discharged on apixaban for three months.

]. Many of these patients are being treated on the general medical floors, and this case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for thrombosis even in mild COVID-19 cases. Our patient required no supplemental oxygen, received standard DVT prophylaxis and had only a mild elevation of D-dimer on initial admission, but still subsequently developed a debilitating thrombosis. Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with VTE and tangible worldwide prevalence of COVID-19 infections, physicians should be aware of thrombotic complications even in mild cases. Further study is required to demonstrate the prevalence of VTE, appropriate screening metrics and need for ongoing VTE prophylaxis even after discharge for patients with mild COVID-19 disease.

Background:
To investigate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed a single institutional study to evaluate its prevalence, risk factors, prognosis, and potential thromboprophylaxis strategies in a large referral and treatment center.

Methods:
We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29 to February 29, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups.

Conclusions:
The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score >= 4 after admission. Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients."

To the Editor:

The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has reported that as of February 24, 2020, a total of 3387 of 77,262 patients with Covid-19 (4.4%) in China were health care workers or others who worked in medical facilities.
1,2
According to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and public media, as of April 3, a total of 23 of the health care professionals among these 3387 persons had died from Covid-19 after they became infected during the practice of medicine in Wuhan and elsewhere in China.
3,4

The median age of the 23 health care workers who died was 55 years (range, 29 to 72); 17 were men and 6 were women. Eighteen of the health care workers were from Wuhan, 4 were from areas of Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and 1 was from Hainan Province (see Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix
, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Eleven of these persons had been rehired after retirement, and at least 5 were known to have had a chronic condition such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or post-polio syndrome. Thirteen were physicians who provided direct patient care (5 practiced in community health centers or in private clinics, 3 practiced Chinese medicine, 2 were internal medicine physicians, 2 were physicians in respiratory medicine, and 1 was a gastroenterologist); 8 were surgeons (including 3 ophthalmologic surgeons); 1 was an electrocardiography technician; and 1 was a nurse.

The median period from the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 to hospital admission in the 19 health care workers for whom these data were available in public media reports was 6 days (range, 0 to 15). Three of them died in late January, 17 died in February, and 3 died in early March. The median period from hospital admission to death in all 23 health care workers was 19 days (range, 1 to 47). In 16 of the health care workers, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rapidly progressed, and their condition then deteriorated quickly; all but 3 of these persons were 50 years of age or older. After their condition deteriorated, 12 of the 23 health care workers were transferred from the hospitals where they were first admitted to specialized intensive care units in other hospitals or to hospitals that specialize in infectious diseases. In addition to ARDS, the complications of Covid-19 in these patients included cardiac injury, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, hypercoagulability, intracardiac thrombus, and bacteremia.

Only 2 of the 23 health care workers were physicians in respiratory medicine who had been specifically assigned to treat patients with Covid-19. None of the 23 patients who died were from hospital divisions of infectious diseases or worked in hospitals that specialized in infectious diseases. The infections in these patients may have resulted from inadequate precautions and insufficient protection in the early stages of the epidemic.

As of March 31, none of the 42,600 health care workers who went to Hubei Province to care for patients with Covid-19 were known to have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
5
The 42,600 workers included one of us, an intensive care physician from Fujian Province who cared for patients with Covid-19 from January 29 to March 23, first in Wuhan Central Hospital, and then in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. These data suggest that sufficient precautions with rigorous enforcement can prevent health care workers from becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent risk of death. The 23 health care heroes described here were dedicated to saving the lives of others in a catastrophic pandemic that has been plaguing our country and many others around the globe."

The recent joint statement from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) recommends neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) illness. The benefits of regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques on patient outcomes and healthcare systems are evident. Regional techniques are now additionally promoted as a mechanism to reduce aerosolizing procedures. However, caring for patients with COVID-19 illness requires rapid redefinition of risks and benefits--both for patients and practitioners. These should be fully considered within the context of available evidence and expert opinion. In this Daring Discourse, we present two opposing perspectives on adopting the ASRA/ESRA recommendation. Areas of controversy in the literature and opportunities for research to address knowledge gaps are highlighted. We hope this will stimulate dialogue and research into the optimal techniques to improve patient outcomes and ensure practitioner safety during the pandemic.

Abstract

As of April 15, 2020, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 1,870,000 individuals, posing an unprecedented threat to international health and the economy. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness."

Diagnostic procedures and tools that promote efficiency and accuracy in care should be appropriately utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.

*

TEE offers those caring for intubated critically-ill patients a high-quality imaging modality capable of answering goal-directed questions that can impact decision making at the bedside.

*

TEE can be useful during the pandemic when adequate TTE windows cannot be obtained, when there is need to address hemodynamic instability during prone ventilation, to perform serial evaluations of the lungs, during cardiac arrest resuscitation and to guide veno-venous ECMO cannulation.

*

Despite plausibility as an aerosol generating procedure, based on the available evidence and experience in the frontlines our group of interdisciplinary experts from across North America support the use of TEE as an invaluable tool for managing the critically ill patient with COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary strain on healthcare systems across North America. Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically-ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well-suited to answer questions at bedside. A multi-disciplinary group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE representing intensive care, critical care cardiology and emergency medicine from the United States and Canada, convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aimed to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. Among other critical care applications, TEE can allow hemodynamic assessment of patients during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs during recruitment maneuvers, guide cardiac arrest resuscitation, and facilitate veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, equipment required before, during, and after an examination. In the right clinical scenario, TEE is a tool that can provide the information needed to deliver the best and safest possible care for the critically ill patient.

Abstract

Covid-19 is characterized by weak symptoms in most affected patients whilst severe clinical complications, with frequent fatal issues, occur in others. Disease severity is associated with age and comorbidities. Understanding of viral infectious mechanisms, and antibody immune response, can help to better control disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 has a major impact on the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), through its binding to the membrane cellular glycoprotein, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), then infecting cells for replication. This report hypothesizes the possible implication of an autoimmune response, induced by generation of allo- or autoantibodies to ACE-2, or to its complexes with viral spike protein. This could contribute to some delayed severe complications occurring in affected patients. We also propose a strategy for investigating this eventuality."

COVID-19 aggravates the inequalities and uncertainties of science in general. This is no different when it comes to the heart. Unlike other epidemics caused by respiratory viruses, COVID-19 affects the heart, not only because most confirmed cases and deaths involve individuals with hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias and coronary artery disease, but also because the disease is associated with a higher number of cardiac complications, such as myocardial injury, cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo syndrome, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis and arrhythmia.

Apart from inflammation, endothelial activation, oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, platelet activation and tissue factor expression caused by respiratory virus epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS), poor COVID-19 prognosis is compounded by the deleterious effect of the association of treatment drugs (chloroquine/azithromycin) that can cause malignant arrhythmias in patients with heart disease.
3

The challenges concerning COVID-19 are huge, because it tests us all - patients, healthcare personnel, health systems and the general population. In light of this, the importance of the safety of healthcare workers has never been so emphasized.
2

Working in a hospital during a pandemic of a highly contagious disease, such as COVID-19, reminds healthcare workers of the need to reinforce all safety measures inside a cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). That is because, in addition to the cardiovascular alterations due to COVID-19, patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction and advanced structural diseases, continue to require interventional procedures.

Therefore, the safety measures for healthcare professionals and patients become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the safety issues that might affect both patients and healthcare personnel are as follows: ionizing radiation, equipment, and contact with chemical and biological agents. All health professionals in contact with patients should follow the local and national guidelines for infection control and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which should be available and on hand for all staff members. In addition, strict adherence to all safety rules required for a catheterization procedure indication should be encouraged; moreover, all urgent cases should be prioritized, and all routine cases postponed if this carries no loss to either prognosis or the patients' quality of life.
4

The Brazilian Society of Interventional Cardiology (SBHCI) has published a position statement on some general measures to tackle COVID-19: limitation of social exposure; adoption of stricter personal hygiene habits; home confinement of individuals with the mild form of COVID-19; hospital support with isolation for patients with the severe forms of the disease; quarantine for the close contacts of suspected cases; priority allocation of healthcare resources to urgent and emergent cases; protection of the professionals involved in patients' care. In addition, regarding specifically the CCL, the SBHCI recommends: to postpone elective procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19; to limit the performance of CCL procedures to cardiovascular emergencies, and, for the other cases, procedures must be postponed until the non-infecting stage of disease; in CCLs with multiple procedure rooms, one should be dedicated to the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
5

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general safety protocols and those concerning CCL procedures, as well as the safety measures for patients and healthcare personnel need to be reviewed, because that infection increases the requirements for indication and effectiveness of the procedures performed.

Safety measures in the procedure preparation stage

A study conducted in China with 72,314 patients with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 16,186 suspected cases, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases) has reported fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue and diarrhea as the most common symptoms. Other signs and symptoms have been reported, such as sore throat, chest pain, mental confusion, and lethargy. The authors have highlighted that COVID-19 had a benign course in 80% of the cases, and that many patients, although asymptomatic, could carry the virus.
6
It is worth noting the importance of the differential diagnosis of dyspnea and fatigue, especially when associated with the other symptoms.

During a respiratory pandemic, patients and their families should be informed about the risks of contamination, despite all additional measures taken to minimize them. Because the number of elective procedures will be drastically reduced during that period, the length of hospital stay is predicted to be the minimum necessary for each protocol consensually elaborated.
7
Moreover, defining a procedure as elective requires clinical judgement, because postponing it might have effects that will increase the likelihood of decompensation and adverse events during the pandemic, such as in high-risk patients with unstable angina. Therefore, the decision about performing a procedure should be individualized and based on the patient's risk and benefit analysis.
8

Despite the adoption of measures to reduce exposure, healthcare personnel shortage should be anticipated based on the likelihood of the removal of infected, exposed, at-risk and quarantined healthcare personnel. Particular attention should be given to avoid simultaneous exposure of healthcare professionals sharing the same skill set to prevent simultaneous contamination, especially in teaching institutions where the staff usually act together.
4
In addition, it is worth emphasizing the importance of reducing as much as possible the circulation in the procedure room to ensure the minimum safety threshold established in CCL procedural protocols.
4

It is worth noting that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should ideally undergo procedures at the end of the day or in CCL rooms dedicated to COVID-19, when available, because of the need for terminal disinfection.
4

Patients already intubated represent a lower risk of contamination to healthcare personnel, because they are on closed-loop ventilation. In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who need orotracheal intubation, this intervention should be performed before arrival to the CCL; in addition, intubation should be considered as early as possible in borderline patients to avoid the need for an urgent procedure and to minimize the contamination of the staff.
4

Safety measures concerning the procedures

Healthcare personnel exposure and benefits to patients should be balanced for all interventional procedures. For example, during a respiratory epidemic, for hemodynamically stable patients with COVID19+ and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, fibrinolysis might be an alternative according to some authors;
6
,
9
however, the length of hospital stay waiting for coronary angioplasty after fibrinolysis should be carefully considered.

It is worth noting that COVID19 is spread via respiratory droplets and contact with surfaces on which the virus can last for long periods, such as cell phone, keyboard, mouse and door handles, thus, the procedure duration should be reduced to a minimum.
10
,
11
Moreover, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be using a face mask upon arrival to the CCL and continue to use it during procedure preparation and the procedure itself.
4

All CCL personnel should wear PPE, including FFP2/N95 respirators, goggles, full face shields, disposable caps, gowns, surgical gloves, and shoe covers, during the entire procedure, because of the potential for those patients' clinical deterioration and the consequent risk that comes with intubation, aspiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In addition, CCL staff should be well educated in the proper donning and doffing of PPE because of the high likelihood of contamination involved in the process.
3

5

It is worth noting that myocardial injury has been reported in 7% of the patients with COVID-19 and might correspond to type 2 myocardial infarction or myocarditis.
11
Thus, no effort should be spared in reaching the differential diagnosis before the procedure with the aid of imaging tests, such as point-of-care echocardiography.

In addition, it is worth emphasizing that percutaneous coronary intervention should only be performed to the culprit vessel, unless a nonculprit lesion is deemed unstable or in the presence of multiple culprit lesions.
12

Post-procedure safety measures

During the pandemic, in anticipation of a surge in hospitalization required for COVID-19 infected patients and because not only most inpatient beds will be made available for COVID-19 treatment, but also to avoid additional contamination, hospital discharge will occur earlier for stable patients who might be followed up via telemedicine.
12

Within the CCL, all nonessential equipment should be moved out of the procedure room or covered with clear drapes before patient's arrival to the room, and the same applies to the control and post-procedure recovery rooms. After a procedure in a patient with COVID-19, thorough terminal disinfection can be performed with ultraviolet light.
12

The standard positive pressure ventilation system of the CCL consists of an air-handling unit that distributes conditioned air to different functional units, including the procedure, post-procedure, and control rooms. Positive pressure with adequate air changes can rapidly eliminate the virus from the environment; in addition the risk of cross-contamination from airborne infections has been shown to be low if the personnel is protected with appropriate PPE.
9
The positive pressure ventilation system should be extended to the rooms associated with the procedure.

It is worth noting that the inflammatory state of patients with COVID-19 often determines a hypercoagulable condition that requires additional use of heparin.
11

Figure 1
shows the safety recommendations for CCL procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those written in bold letters should receive special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, all material used for invasive procedures, including the equipment for anesthesia, orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, in addition to PPEs, should undergo a daily check and be readily available for easy and rapid use to minimize the work and burnout of healthcare professionals.
13

The PPE should be removed preferably in an anteroom. If no anteroom is available, doffing of PPE should be done inside the procedure room, at the end of the procedure and after the patient has been transferred away, except for the PPE for respiratory protection, which must be removed outside the procedure room.
13

Post-procedure visits should be performed by the lowest number possible of professionals; moreover, discussions about additional management should be converted to an online or telephone format, and the same applies to morning CCL rounds.
12
-
14

Most sanitizers contain alcohol at different concentrations and are used for cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces (floor, walls, ceiling, and countertops), a precaution that is important during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, a single-strand RNA virus, is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat, being inactivated by lipid solvents, such as ether (75%), ethanol, sanitizers containing chlorine, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform, except for chlorhexidine.
15

Terminal disinfection of the procedure room at the end of each procedure is highly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Disposable PPE, sheets, fabric, and sponges contaminated with blood should be placed into a waste container marked with the biological hazard symbol and disposed into a waste bin labeled as 'COVID-19'.
10

A recent case series of 5700 inpatients with COVI-19 (median age, 63 years; male sex, 60.3%) in the city of New York, United States, has reported a high prevalence of comorbidities, especially cardiovascular ones, as follows: arterial hypertension, 56.6%; coronary artery disease, 11.1%; heart failure, 6.9%; obesity, 41.7%; and diabetes, 33.8%. In-hospital lethality rate was 21%, which increased to 88% among those requiring mechanical ventilation. In addition, the authors have reported that most patients maintained their routine medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. These data reinforce the need to maintain the traditional treatment of patients with heart diseases to avoid decompensation during the pandemic.
29

The challenges presented during the COVID-19 pandemic are huge, not only the approach of patients with cardiovascular diseases, who need to continue their treatments regardless of having or not COVID-19, but also the management of the complex cardiovascular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome and myocardial injury, which can mimic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In addition, patients usually delay seeking hospital treatment because of fear of contamination.
30
,
31

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the established strategies, such as primary angioplasty, remain the standard treatment. These strategies should be performed at hospitals that are well equipped for a timely response and that have a team of specialized professionals wearing the aforementioned PPEs. The fibrinolysis-based strategy should be reserved for situations in which primary angioplasty cannot be performed.
31

Although interventional cardiology certainly entails more engaging topics than safety, extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is essential to revisit the different aspects of protection for patients and healthcare personnel in the CCL, as well as to tailor them to the COVID-19 scenario.

Health systems around the world have been overwhelmed for months. However, unlike ventilators and wards, healthcare personnel cannot be 'manufactured' urgently, mainly highly specialized professionals, such as CCL staff.
32

All activities performed in CCL rooms need to be restructured, and registries should be kept to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. In doing so, we will be able to learn from this pandemic and thereby both add value to this field and contribute to a rapidly growing body of knowledge on COVID-19.

Abstract

The world entered the year 2020 with reports of the emergence of a new viral illness in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to be the causative novel coronavirus for the cluster of patients suffering from pneumonia in China. The disease was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Several studies, since then, have tried to study and explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its structure and pathogenicity, epidemiology, modes of transmission, spectrum of illness and causes of mortality and morbidity. The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications. With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope. This review intends to cover the current known aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-19, based on the available literature.

This concise manuscript aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis or affinity column- derived antibodies, both are sterilised and pathogen inactivated for substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This include for use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available.

Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT. Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selected COVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability. The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the two to 3 doses of viral inactivated antibodies, which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage. So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.

Background

In this concise manuscript we are pleased to offer readers some new proposals on the usefulness of of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), in both preventative and therapeutics measures, against this pandemic virus. We have brought together in one document some relevant methodological studies, which have been used as support for implementation of CCP in the pandemic. Readers should be aware that in the absence of any randomized controlled data is to be expected that the hidden COVID- related illnesses in millions of patients would continue. In fact, the sheer numbers of individuals afflicted with and dying from COVID-19 present a clear ethical, racial as well as scientific requirement that the health care system seek truth regarding treatments. We can only hope that our new proposal on CCP will be a beneficial treatment, as a preliminary report and might encourage the others to apply these methodologies as the proof of principals. Although bypassing randomized controlled investigation of CCP may be tempting given the sense of urgency a mistake repeated is a decision taken to study first before wide scale implementation risks doing more harm to both patients and the health care system considering the possible harms that untreated CCP might bring about as a long term therapy and it is important the informed consent is in place and serves to remind us in the implementation of the ultimate importance of good scientific methodologies.

New proposals on convalescent plasma

This paper aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID 19) pandemic. This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis, plasma exchange or substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This would include use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and, as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available. This would be a small step forward, while we are waiting to produce an effective, validated vaccine and witnessing increasing testing and self-isolation which are the two most effective current strategies.

In line with this concept, some methodological aspects of the use of the UVC sterilization of FFP/ cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against COVID-19 are highlighted. The plasmapheresis procedure is, of course, particularly targeted to male donors, who consist of about 75 % of the COVID-19 population and who are able to undergo multiple double, or even triple plasmapheresis procedures. Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT. Similarly, recipients getting at least two doses of high affinity antibodies directed against COVID 19 should, on evidence based physiologically, have benefit too.

Needless to emphasize that, conceptually, the safety of donors in such special cases is paramount. An additional bonus to donors is that, in these author's experiences, many laboratory hemostatic abnormalities are often seen in critically ill COVID-infected patients, this is considered to be a very important clinical issue, in view of the high incidence of thrombotic events observed in this population, some with a fatal outcome. Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selectedCOVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability. The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the antibodies which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage. So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.

Both the plasmapheresis collection process and plasma exchange are very well accepted clinical procedures in transfusion practice in countries that are equipped with modern mobile apheresis technologies. Such mobile and fully automated tools, using digital technology, will allow this well-established practice to be available for use, by either a nurse or trained phlebotomy technologist who might be able to run 6 donors under the supervision of a trained skilled clinician even in home care sites. Therefore, transfusion of plasma or its derived products containing immunoglobulin from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 will be an additional intervention to be used for those who are not able to defend themselves against this pandemic virus, in the absence of the relevant vaccine. While early infection is identified by modern and sensitive RNA based PCR testing, extensive community testing for antibody will be required to find recovered patients who will volunteer to help others by donating plasma. e Meanwhile, the current concept of mass testing by sensitive and reliable PCR methodology, mass tracking and the recently proposed strategy of segregating and isolating the older populations, who are more at risk of getting fatal infections will be perused with rigour, to reduce the current rise in deaths. There is also an increase in fatalities in younger population as this virus does not recognize age or race and individual variability appears to matter as to how an individual responds to viral infection.

Conceptually, this therapeutic approach is based on well-established passive immunotherapy and will use u neutralizing anti-COV-2 immunoglobulins, thought to be present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Moreover, such a therapeutic intervention can be considered as a true reflection of the precision transfusion concept, consisting of the use of the right product for the right patient in the right time and the right condition, with no risk but added health benefits to donors and recipients alike. We would like to emphasize that these individuals will often be at an elevated risk for thrombosis and VTE, hence an appropriate risk assessment at the same time will be warranted and plasmapheresis donations, with citrated anticoagulant, would enormously help in lowering their existing and or induced-hypercoagulability by COVID -19. Evidence is accumulating that this might occur. In fact, as mentioned above, we believe that hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 infected patients are considered to be a very important issue, as these patients experience not only some laboratory abnormalities as well as a high clinical incidence of thrombotic events some of which are fatal.

In this context, it should be noted that the safety and efficacy of convalescent COVID-19 plasma as a treatment for COVID-19 is yet to be validated. However, even as an experimental therapy, in line with the first principal of all newer bioproducts for transfusion, one needs to be consistent with ethical and legal safeguards (informed consent of donors and patients, institutional approval, special labeling as an investigational product, and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements). Moreover, COVID-19 plasma should be used in the context of an organized research study designed to determine its safety and efficacy in comparison with standard of care or other therapeutic interventions. Even if used empirically it is vital to ensure monitoring of patient outcomes including clinical and laboratory indicators of safety and efficacy to optimized/ maximize the knowledge that might be gained.

Currently, the collection process and transfusion of plasma derived from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 is of wide spread interest both nationally and internationally as the development of the infection and its propagation are pandemic. Therefore, using neutralizing anti-COV-2 immunoglobulins that are present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma is logically an interesting targeted therapeutic approach, acting on the foundation of the well-established concept of passive immunotherapy.

Transfusion services and many other establishments with the appropriate skills in handling therapeutic apheresis have the appropriate know how to effectively perform this process. Therefore, a protocol that is based on local community testing, which is becoming an essential part of the current strategy is warranted. As highlighted before this will be of benefit to both recipients and donors. There is, moreover another, validated strategic safety measure that could be implemented for the quality improvement of plasmapheresis FFP and its derived cryo supernatant, based on pathogen reduction with UVC. This has been validated and uses the principle of sterilization to kill both viruses and bacteria.

. This method has a very good safety record. Alternatively, the application affinity column derived specific antibodies might prove useful as an essential part of a relevant clinical research development for purer and safer products.

In respect to total quality management of the whole process from donor to recipient, several key points of total quality management need to be addressed:

1)

The collection and retention of blood specimens from both donors and recipients (pre- and post- treatment) to permit retrospective determination of the characteristics of an effective product and dosage regimen, as well as the characteristics of patients most likely to benefit from this intervention.

2)

The collection of convalescent plasma only by apheresis in order to avoid unnecessary loss of red cells in the donor and to optimize the volume of plasma that can be generated for investigational use. Double plasmapheresis technologies and even triple procedures can be applied under continual supervision, if required and donor conditions permit.

3)

The suitability criteria of COVID19 convalescent plasma prepared from whole blood by component separation and considered for investigational use, if not clinically needed for general patient care. Transfusion of whole blood to provide convalescent plasma as a general rule should be avoided unless use of whole blood is clinically indicated.

Moreover, from both laboratory and clinical stand points, several other key items should be taken into consideration as critical preparative and therapeutic modalities, embodying: a.] The eligibility of convalescent COVID-19 individuals to donate whole blood or plasma with the following essential requirements; b.] Confirmation of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 by a record of a validated diagnostic test at the time of illness; c.] An interval of at least 14 days after full recovery; d.] A standard selection criterion for whole blood or plasma donation according to local requirements and standard operational procedures; e.] To avoid the risk of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) preference should be given to the use of plasma from male donors or from female donors who have never been pregnant including having abortions. This measure is now well-established to dramatically lower the possibility of the presence in plasma of antibodies to HLA or granulocyte antigens that cause TRALI and appear to occur within 6 h after transfusion of the implicated plasma; f.]The assessment of hypercoagulability which is of particular relevance to patients with COVID-19, should be fully assessed.

4)

It is essential that pre-screening and pre-donation testing of convalescent COVID-19 donors' recovery from COVID-19 infection should be confirmed; a.] Physical examination of the donor to establish good health including the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms; b.] If plasma is collected prior to 28 days after full recovery from illness, then confirmation of the resolution of the infection should be obtained through demonstration of two non-reactive Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 performed at an interval of at least 24 h on nasopharyngeal swabs; c] Viral inactivation of convalescent plasma is encouraged to address residual risks of known transfusion transmissible viruses in an experimental product; d.] The approximate date of COVID-19 infection, history of symptoms, treatments received and date of resolution of all symptoms should be documented and traceable; e.] The total and neutralizing titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies determined as part of product characterization before use. Furthermore, donor blood/serum/plasma samples should be saved and frozen at -80 degC for retrospective testing and further scientific investigations.

5)

It is also essential that the main criteria for collection of COVID-19 plasma should be fully documented: a.] Performed in certified blood establishments (or under exceptional circumstances, hospitals and other health care facilities routinely engaged in performing whole blood collection with plasma separation and/or apheresis procedures) by appropriately trained staff; b.] Use only of legally approved blood collection or plasmapheresis equipment under standard operating procedures; c.] Supervision of the collection process by trained staff; d.] Volume of plasma to be collected: at least 200-600 mL (without anticoagulant) based on the procedure and regulatory limits; e.]Plasma units intended for use as convalescent plasma should be clearly labeled. The first plasma donation can be followed by further donations at a frequency compliant with local regulations and taking into account the health status of the donor (in many jurisdictions the interval between apheresis plasma donations of 600 mL or more should not be less than 7 days and that between whole blood donations should be at least eight weeks)

6)

Post-donation treatment of plasma record keeping: a.] Where feasible, pathogen inactivation of plasma using a licensed technology is highly desirable to ensure the current strategies are strictly in place to effectively optimize the current practices that are in use in some European establishments. This is an essential regulatory requirement to control the residual risks of transfusion transmitted infectious diseases and to allay concern about possible superinfections with SARS COV-2. This is a controversial point since pathogen inactivation cannot be performed in all transfusion services, therefore limiting the widespread use of this treatment modality, despite being available in many modern establishments and existing even in some hospitals.

b.] Freezing as soon as possible at -30 degC or preferably colder and stored frozen until administration; c.] Convalescent plasma collected from donors who do not fulfill post-COVID-19 suitability criteria for blood donation should be stored separately from othersconventional FFP; d.] Plasma sample aliquots should be taken for archiving at -80 degC and future potential scientific investigations.

a.] To follow standard procedures and recommendations for thawing and transfusion of plasma; b.] It is crucial to ensure ABO compatibility between the donor and the recipient; c.] Transfusion of plasma from at least two donors may be therapeutically beneficial to achieve a more effective immune protection from delivery of diverse antibodies; d.] In the absence of published peer-reviewed reports of transfusion of convalescent COVID-19 plasma, patients could receive an initial dose of 200 mL, followed by one or two additional doses of 200 mL according to disease severity and tolerance of the infusions: e.] Further information on blood/serum/plasma samples of the recipient prior to and after transfusion should be taken for future potential scientific investigations.

Another highly important issue that needs to be highlighted and emphasized is plasmapheresis in immunocompromised patients particularly in cases of haematological malignancy.Since morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus are highest in the elderly and inindividuals with underlying co-morbidities, it would be of great interest to identify the most susceptible disease categories for COVID-19 infection with the aim of proposing specific therapeutic interventions.

With nearly 50,000 hematopoietic cell transplantations (HSCT) carried out annually, patients who are actively undergoing a HSCT, or those who survived HSCT with compromised immune systems make up a large population of susceptible patients in which COVID-19 infection may lead to severe pulmonary distress and could be fatal.

COVID 19-related pneumonia is mediated by hyper activation of effector T cells and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, interferon-gamma, and TNF. This inflammatory process may cause a pathological process that leads to plasma leakage, vascular permeability, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; this reaction, called ""cytokine storm"" is a life-threatening complication of COVID 19 infection. The immunocompromised status associated with hematological malignancies may enhance the risk of bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 and other viral infections.

Based on the above, it might be postulated that either the preventive or the therapeutic use of convalescent plasma may be beneficial in these patient subcategories, possibly mitigating the impact of COVID-19.

However, well-designed clinical trials are needed to clarify this point. An Italian study has recently started (called ""the Italian Hematology Alliance"") with the main goal of assessing the incidence and potential predictive parameters of mortality of COVID 19 in patients with hematological malignancies.

In conclusion, we believe that the suggested protocol of targeted plasmapheresis of volunteer recovered COVID 19 patients, constitutes a feasible, well- established and effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of critically ill patients with severe respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock in COVID-19- infected patients. The phase of the disease in which this treatment modality may be most beneficial is still a matter of debate (early vs intermediate-late stages of the cytokine storm reaction phase associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other severe disease complications).

Moreover, as highlighted above, these patients who often present with some laboratory abnormalities and a high incidence of thrombosis, some fatal, will benefit from intervention as their hypercoagulable states will improve and normalized. The added process of sterilization of the plasma would make it even safer in line with the use of the best available therapy.

We also support the possibility of using on- line affinity columns for removing either the COVID 19 virus itself or its antibodies from the circulation of donors or patients. This process has been recently successfully achieved for hemophilia B patients, with a very high titter of antibodies to Factor IX in Malmo Sweden. t this approach could be used for COVID patients with various matrixes to selectively remove the antigen or the antibodies, according to need and the column could be subsequently desorbed to obtain purer substances.

In fact, a capture ELISA, with a plate coated with recombinant ACE-2, or its complexes with S-Protein or its S1 subunit, as a specific receptor, could be designed for capturing possible allo- or autoantibodies present in COVID 19 patients, especially those with delayed severe complications. This would allow measurement of the kinetics of these antibodies during the pathological evolution. If present, these antibodies are expected to be alloantibodies, induced by the association of the viral protein. A similar design could be constructed on an affinity column matrix to capture antibodies or antigen as required either in the circulation or from FFP-derived from COVID 19 plasma. Nevertheless, in practice, what we need urgently is not easily matched with what we want.

Based on the concept of plasmapheresis of recovered volunteer COVID19 patients we believe this is an attractive achievable project which will benefit the targeted donors and the targeted recipients until a proper effective vaccine is developed and validated.

Such activities, should be used along with the current efforts in self-discipline and self-isolation s already in place to reduce the impact and ever growing rate of t infection in this crisis which is paralyzing the economy and having major impacts on the health of the international community at large, beyond imaginable limits. There are, in life, many challenges to overcome but, the present crisis is beyond comprehension, and only by joining forces in a team effort can we turn these challenges into opportunities.

This project is only one small step forward in an overall, difficult task but it is achievable with due perseverance and hope. The single message to convey to all scientific communities from this note is to ""isolate, isolate, isolate"" the population at risk or with potential risks of thrombosis and to collect the precious FFP to be used for the population in most need during this pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease. This approach to both the patients and donors involved could be considered as a double edged sword with benefits to both patients and donors in this pandemic. Specific recommendations for a standardized preparation, and an optimal use of convalescent plasma at a global level are needed for COVID 19 patients. They will be helpful in designing future clinical trials in this area of investigation.

This paper aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This would include use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and, as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available."

Abstract

Background

Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with respiratory virus diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.

Objectives

To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19.

Search methods

The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53

We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group).

We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity.

Data collection and analysis

We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment.

To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support.

We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively.

Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19

The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma.

All-cause mortality at hospital discharge

All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence).

Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support)

Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence).

Time to discharge from hospital

Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy.

Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU)

Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation.

Length of stay on the ICU

Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion.

Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19

Grade 3 or 4 adverse events

The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 degC). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events

One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low.

No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.

Plain language summary

Plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 to treat individuals with COVID-19

Background

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by a new strain of virus. The outbreak has spread rapidly on a global scale. People infected with this virus may not show signs of the disease, others may develop symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat. In some people the infection is more severe and can cause severe breathing difficulties, leading to hospitalisation, admission to intensive care or death. Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment is available.

People who have recovered from COVID-19 develop natural defences to the disease in their blood (antibodies). Antibodies are found in part of the blood called plasma. Plasma from blood donated from recovered patients, which contains COVID-19 antibodies, can be used to make two preparations. Firstly, convalescent plasma, which is plasma that contains these antibodies. Secondly, hyperimmune immunoglobulin, which is more concentrated, and therefore contains more antibodies.

Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin have been used successfully to treat other respiratory viruses. These treatments (given by a drip or injection) are generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur.

What did we want to find?

We wanted to know whether plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is an effective treatment for people with COVID-19, and whether this treatment causes any unwanted effects.

Our methods

We searched major medical databases for clinical studies on treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19. Studies could be conducted anywhere in the world and include participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19.

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer this question quickly. This meant that we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process - only one review author extracted data from studies and assessed study quality; normally two review authors would do this.

Key results

We included eight completed studies, with 32 participants who received convalescent plasma. None of the studies randomly allocated participants to different treatments (randomised trials produce the best evidence). None of the studies included a group of people who did not receive convalescent plasma, as a comparison group.

All participants in the studies were alive at the end of follow-up, but not all had been discharged from hospital. Follow-up varied from 3 to 37 days after treatment with convalescent plasma.

Six studies used the level of breathing support that participants required as a measure of recovery. Breathing support included oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation and the need for a special machine that oxygenates the blood. All six studies reported clinical improvement in at least some of their participants, but it remains uncertain whether this improvement was related to convalescent plasma, another treatment, or the natural progression of the disease.

Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for some of their participants, all of whom received convalescent plasma. The time to discharge ranged from 4 to 35 days after convalescent plasma treatment.

Six studies included participants with severe COVID-19. Most had improved at final follow-up, but this improvement may have been due to another treatment, the natural progression of the disease or convalescent plasma treatment.

Two participants reported unwanted effects related to convalescent plasma. One participant developed a fever, and a second participant experienced anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction) early on in the transfusion.

Certainty of the evidence

Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was very limited because the studies were not randomised and did not use reliable methods to measure their results. Furthermore, they had only a small number of participants, who received various treatments alongside convalescent plasma, and some had underlying health problems.

Conclusion

We are very uncertain whether plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is an effective treatment for people with COVID-19. The completed studies we found were poor quality and their results could be related to the natural progression of the disease, other treatments that the participants received, or to convalescent plasma. However, our searches found 48 ongoing studies: 47 evaluating convalescent plasma and 1 evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 22 are randomised. We will update this review with their results when these studies are completed.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence

High certainty
: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

Moderate certainty
: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

Low certainty
: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low certainty
: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

a
Risk of bias within and across studies is serious, so we downgraded two points for risk of bias. We included observational studies only, so we started assessment from 'low' certainty evidence.
b
We downgraded two points for imprecision because of the very small information size and nonexisting control group; effect estimates cannot be calculated.
c
We identified clinical heterogeneity among participants (different severity of disease, comorbidities, different number and type of previous treatments), so we downgraded one point for inconsistency.
d
We included observational studies only, so we started assessment from low-certainty evidence and did not summarise outcome data across studies.
e
We assume these adverse events are grade 3-4; studies did not report grading of adverse events.

Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therapeutic options including antimalarials, antivirals, and vaccines are under study. Meanwhile the current pandemic has called attention over old therapeutic tools to treat infectious diseases. Convalescent plasma (CP) constitutes the first option in the current situation, since it has been successfully used in other coronaviruses outbreaks. Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of CP and their repercussion in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including direct neutralization of the virus, control of an overactive immune system (
i.e.
, cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, complement activation) and immunomodulation of a hypercoagulable state. All these benefits of CP are expected to be better achieved if used in non-critically hospitalized patients, in the hope of reducing morbidity and mortality."

Continuity of care and outpatient management for patients with and at high risk for cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scientific statement from the American Society for Preventive Cardiology

Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has consumed our healthcare system, with immediate resource focus on the management of high numbers of critically ill patients. Those that fare poorly with COVID-19 infection more commonly have cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes. There are also several other conditions that raise concern for the welfare of patients with and at high risk for CVD during this pandemic. Traditional ambulatory care is disrupted and many patients are delaying or deferring necessary care, including preventive care. New impediments to medication access and adherence have arisen. Social distancing measures can increase social isolation and alter physical activity and nutrition patterns. Virtually all facility based cardiac rehabilitation programs have temporarily closed. If not promptly addressed, these changes may result in delayed waves of vulnerable patients presenting for urgent and preventable CVD events.

Here, we provide several recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects of these disruptions in outpatient care. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be continued in patients already taking these medications. Where possible, it is strongly preferred to continue visits via telehealth, and patients should be counselled about promptly reporting new symptoms. Barriers to medication access should be reviewed with patients at every contact, with implementation of strategies to ensure ongoing provision of medications. Team-based care should be leveraged to enhance the continuity of care and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Patient encounters should include discussion of safe physical activity options and access to healthy food choices. Implementation of adaptive strategies for cardiac rehabilitation is recommended, including home based cardiac rehab, to ensure continuity of this essential service. While the practical implementation of these strategies will vary by local situation, there are a broad range of strategies available to ensure ongoing continuity of care and health preservation for those at higher risk of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Introduction

We recently reported a high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three Dutch hospitals. In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses.

Methods

We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first.

Results

We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41-57%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8).

Conclusion

In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."

Abstract

Cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) is a rare disorder associated with infection, autoimmune disorders, and lymphoid malignancies. We are present a case of CAS associated with SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. A 46-year-old female presented with severe anemia and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR. Direct Coombs test was positive to IgG and complement. LDH was elevated and haptoglobin was undetectable. Peripheral smear revealed RBC agglutination, marked polychromasia, and many nucleated RBCs. Unfortunately, as a result of her severe hypoxemia, patient went into pulseless electrical activity before receiving transfusion and subsequently died. We postulate that CAS can be associated with COVID-19, and ongoing surveillance is required for potential association.

Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis
, Harzallah and colleagues report the results of antiphospholipid antibody testing in a series of 56 patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
1
Twenty-five patients were found to be positive for lupus anticoagulants, while five patients had either anticardiolipin or anti-b2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies. The isotypes for the anticardiolipin and anti-b2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies were reportedly IgG and IgM, although specific antibody titers and details of which were found in combination with a lupus anticoagulant in three overlap patients were not reported. The authors also reference published work by Zhang and colleagues, who reported three patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and the presence of anticardiolipin IgA and anti-b2-glycoprotein 1 IgA and IgG antibodies who developed cerebral infarcts.
2
Harzallah and colleagues suggest the presence of these antibodies should be used as evidence for early anticoagulation of patients with COVID-19.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are common in the general population, especially during infection.
3
,
4
Whether the IgA isotype alone, noted by Zhang and colleagues, invokes thrombosis remains controversial, with only high titer IgG and IgM isotypes included as diagnostic criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome.
5
Lack of IgG and/or IgM titers in these case series precludes any evaluation of their role in the thrombotic sequelae described.

Thrombosis is common during critical illness and all patients in the Zhang series had preexisting cardiovascular disease, further increasing risk for arterial thrombosis. A key question remains whether COVID-19 patients experience arterial thrombotic events at a higher rate compared to critically ill patients without SARS-CoV-2. The findings presented by Zhang and colleagues cannot confirm anticardiolipin antibodies as the causal agent for the arterial thrombosis observed in their series.

False positive lupus anticoagulant testing might be expected in patients with COVID-19 given the marked elevation in measured C-reactive protein (CRP) levels seen in patients with significant pulmonary or systemic inflammation. Many assays to detect lupus anticoagulants are sensitive to the presence of CRP, resulting in false positive results, further limiting interpretation of this test in the acute inflammatory state.
6

COVID-19 appears to induce a hypercoagulable state, with elevated fibrinogen, and minimal prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, as seen in these patients. The exact mechanisms underlying the coagulopathy are unclear.
7
We urge clinicians who are evaluating coagulation parameters in patients with COVID-19 to be cognizant of the pre-analytic and analytic variables that affect the validity and interpretation of coagulation testing and to adhere to established anticoagulation protocols and guidelines until clinical studies demonstrating efficacy and safety of various anticoagulation strategies are published.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus has spread quickly and become a public health emergency of global concern. Originating in the Wuhan district of China, which has reportedly been declared free of it now, the rest of the world continues to struggle with its severity and spread. While a lot of scientific publications and clinical data are available, newer clinical investigations and experiences continue to evolve, thereby depicting the dynamic nature of the disease and the knowledge around it. Researchers and clinical professionals continue to collect scientific information, clinical data, and evidence to help build a knowledge pool and guidance for the health care professionals to manage those affected with this pandemic disease. As significant and new data emerge, a lot of already available information gets confirmed and updated, while some of it also getting rejected or disapproved. In this article, we aim to put together the scientific and clinical information that is proven so far and the areas where more data or evidence is needed before a clear understanding can be achieved and guidance can be developed.

COVID-19-associated coagulopathy

Background

Of the several viral epidemics that occurred in the past, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease has been the most contagious one, with a rapid spread across the globe.[
1
] As far as the available data suggests, most of the infected patients either have subclinical or mild clinical symptoms, and a small patient population suffers from severe disease manifestations, with viral sepsis leading to single or multiple organ failure or even death being the most common issue.[
2
] COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC), as has become a prevalent term now, is one of the most common hemostaseology findings and is associated with adverse outcomes.[
3
] Accordingly, coagulopathy is one of the most significant prognostic factors in COVID-19. Risk stratification and triage based on predictive laboratory parameters such as D-dimer, IL-6, lymphocyte count, and LDH, as well as clinical scoring systems such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score, and International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (ISTH DIC) score, can help health care professionals and institutions in managing COVID-19 patients and hospital resources such as intensive care unit (ICU) beds, intubation, and ventilator therapy, as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the best way, particularly in times of exponential growth of infected people and limited hospital resources.

Pathogenesis

SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects epithelial cells in the respiratory tract as well as vascular endothelial cells in case of viremia. The virus enters the cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are most commonly found in the alveolar epithelial cells followed by endothelial cells.[
4
] Other organs presenting these receptors are the renal and the gastrointestinal tracts. Furthermore, transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) is a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and is also the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer. The modulation of its expression by sex steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe COVID-19.[
5
]
[
6
] At the same time, this is the rationale for serine protease inhibitors such as camostat as a potential therapeutic intervention (NCT04321096 and NCT04338906).

The incubation period for COVID-19 is around 5 to 14 days.[
7
] The viral infection is capable of triggering an excessive immune reaction in the host, which can, in some patients, result in a ""cytokine storm"" presenting clinically as hyperinflammation.[
8
] The effect is extensive tissue damage and vascular leakage. One protagonist of this ""cytokine storm"" is interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 is produced by activated leukocytes and endothelial cells and acts on multiple cells and tissues.[
9
]
[
10
] Furthermore, IL-6 is also involved in the pathogenesis of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction.

The pathological and clinical changes manifested in patients with COVID-19 can be ascribed mostly to the innate immune response. Here, an imbalance between the non-specific innate immune response (hyperinflammation and activation of macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes) and the specific adaptive immune response (production of specific antibodies by lymphocytes) seems to play an important role.[
11
]
[
12
] Accordingly, high IL-6 levels and low lymphocyte counts are associated with poor outcome in COVID-19.[
13
]
[
14
] This immunological imbalance is typical for older patients (immunosenescence) and patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (inflammaging).[

Clinicopathological Manifestations

Hypercoagulability

There is a growing body of evidence that hypercoagulability is one of the most common pathological manifestation of COVID-19.[
7
] However, the real incidence of macro- or microthrombosis is not known yet. A potential mechanism is the upregulation of tissue factor expression on circulating monocytes, thrombopoietin, and fibrinogen, as well as downregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) by IL-6.[
19
] This results in increased and delocalized thrombin generation as well as increased clot firmness and stability (fibrinolysis resistance). Accordingly, increased D-dimer levels (> 1ug/mL) are a good predictor for poor outcome in COVID-19.[
20
]
[
21
] Due to hemoconcentration, vascular endothelial cell injury, and hypercoagulable state of patients with COVID-19--particularly in patients with obesity, advanced age, and other risk factors--risk of thrombosis is increased in this patient population. Therefore, the risk of venous thromboembolism cannot be ignored during the course and treatment of COVID-19.[
22
] Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients.[
23
] Tang et al reported that patients with SIC score >= 4 or D-dimer > 3 ug/mL (sixfold of the upper limit of normal) showed a significant reduction in 28-day mortality (40 vs. 64.2%,
p
= 0.029; and 32.8 vs. 52.4%,
p
= 0.017, respectively).[
24
] No difference in 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers in the overall population of severe COVID-19 patients (30.3 vs. 29.7%;
p
= 0.910). Therapeutic anticoagulation was performed by administering low molecular weight heparin (40-60 mg enoxaparin/day) or unfractionated heparin (10,000-15,000 U/day) for at least 7 days. As a matter of fact, data is not available for direct oral anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients.

Diffuse Microvascular Damage

Multiple organ failure caused by diffuse microvascular damage and microthrombosis is an important cause of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and may be related to CRS and immune imbalance.[
25
] Around 70% of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors meet the ISTH DIC diagnostic criteria during their hospital stay.[
26
] Most of them present a hypercoagulable state. However, it is unclear whether the pathophysiology of SIC, DIC, and CAC is the same and whether the terms can be used interchangeably.[
27
]

Bleeding Risk

Notably, some COVID-19 patients may also have an increased bleeding risk due to imbalances in platelet production and consumption and other coagulation disorders.[
28
]
[
29
] However, bleeding complications have been reported rarely in COVID-19 patients. It is under investigation whether bleeding complications might occur in a specific subset of COVID-19 patients (medication, comorbidities) or at a specific stage of the disease (severe, late stage).

Laboratory Investigations for Coagulopathy in COVID-19

D-Dimer

Elevated D-dimers can occur in 50% of patients with COVID-19, and fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimers are significantly higher in severe patients and nonsurvivors compared with mild patients and survivors.[
30
] Accordingly, elevated D-dimers have to be considered as a marker of poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection.[
20
]
[
25
] In patients with markedly increased D-dimers (which may be arbitrarily defined as three- to fourfold of the upper limit of normal), admission to hospital should be considered even in the absence of other severity symptoms since it has to considered as a marker of poor outcome.[
31
]

Platelet Count

Thrombocytopenia is a prominent marker of severity or mortality associated with sepsis. However, most patients with COVID-19 have platelet count in the normal range,[
7
] although the incidence of thrombocytopenia varies, the numbers falling with increasing severity.[
32
]

Prothrombin Time

A slight prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) has been observed in severe stages of COVID-19 or in nonsurvivors at the time of admission.[
1
]
[
2
]
[
31
]
[
33
] This is one of the commonly available laboratory coagulation parameters that could serve as predictor of ICU admission.

Fibrinogen

As an acute response protein, fibrinogen may be increased in the course of mild disease and in the early stages of severe patients and can be significantly reduced in the late stages of severe patients. However, the increase in fibrinogen levels is usually less pronounced in viral compared with bacterial sepsis. Nonetheless, fibrinogen forms another significant marker while monitoring DIC or CAC.[
33
]

Hence, for specific monitoring of evolving or established coagulopathy, coagulation laboratory parameters such as D-dimer, platelet count, PT, and fibrinogen are required not only at the time of hospital admission but also during hospital stay for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.[
34
]

Actually, data on the utility of viscoelastic testing devices such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and thromboelastography (TEG) in CAC are limited. The value of ROTEM in predicting the clinical course, need for hospital resources (ICU beds, respiratory therapy, ECMO, etc.), and outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 will be assessed in the ongoing Rotterdam cohort study (ROHOCO). Further research is needed to investigate whether ROTEM/TEG is useful in identifying COVID-19 patients who might benefit from therapeutic anticoagulation and to guide hemostatic therapy in patients with hyper- and hypocoagulability."

Immobilisation and vascular damage are other factors that can increase the risk of thrombosis …,"Many patients with severe COVID-19 present with coagulation abnormalities that mimic other systemic coagulopathies associated with severe infections, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy, but COVID-19 has distinct features.

In this Comment we summarise the characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy, coagulation laboratory findings in affected patients, the prohaemostatic state and incidence of thromboembolic events, and potential therapeutic interventions.

The most typical finding in patients with COVID-19 and coagulopathy is an increased D-dimer concentration, a relatively modest decrease in platelet count, and a prolongation of the prothrombin time. In a series

in 183 patients with COVID-19 in China, a mean D-dimer concentration of 2*12 mg/L (range 0*77-5*27) was measured in patients who didn't survive compared to a concentration of 0*61 mg/L (0*35-1*29) in survivors. A third study

found that patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly higher median D-dimer concentrations (2*4 mg/L, IQR 0*6-14*4) than patients who received no ICU care (0*5 mg/L, 0*3-0*8). In another study,

in consecutive patients with COVID-19 have reported that only about 5% of patients present with a platelet count of less than 100 x 10
9
cells per L. However, mild thrombocytopenia (a platelet count of <150 x 10
9
cells per L) can be found in 70-95% of patients with severe COVID-19. Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 has not been found to be an important predictor of disease progression or adverse outcome.

Mean fibrinogen concentrations in patients with COVID-19 are at the upper limits of normal, presumably as an acute phase response. However, a sudden decrease in plasma fibrinogen to concentrations less than 1*0 g/L was observed shortly before death in a number of patients with COVID-19 in China.

Plasma concentrations of antithrombin are lower in COVID-19 non-survivors than in survivors (84% of normal in non-survivors
vs
91% in survivors); however, plasma concentrations rarely drop below 80% of normal.

In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is usually more profound, and D-dimer concentrations do not reach the high values seen in patients with COVID-19. In fact, most patients with COVID-19 would not be classified as having DIC according to the DIC score of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

Other laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 that might be relevant for the coagulopathy are increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and in some patients, strikingly high ferritin concentrations reminiscent of findings in thrombotic microangiopathy.

Post-mortem findings in patients with COVID-19 show typical microvascular platelet-rich thrombotic depositions in small vessels of the lungs and other organs. However, there are no signs of haemolysis or schistocytes in the blood film and the platelet count is higher than would be expected in case of thrombotic microangiopathy (preprint reference;
appendix
).

Taken together, available evidence suggests that the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 is a combination of low-grade DIC and localised pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy, which could have a substantial impact on organ dysfunction in the most severely affected patients.

Severe COVID-19 is also associated with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukins (IL), including IL-1 and IL-6.

IL-6 can induce tissue factor expression on mononuclear cells, which subsequently initiates coagulation activation and thrombin generation. TNF-a and IL-1 are the main mediators driving a suppression of endogenous anticoagulant pathways. In a subset of patients most severely affected by COVID-19, a cytokine storm profile can be found, characterised by high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Coronavirus infections are also associated with a remarkable activation of the fibrinolytic system. Observations in urokinase-type plasminogen activator knock-out mice pointed to a urokinase-driven pathway stimulating fibrinolysis and being an important factor in lethality. In addition, plasma concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were 6-times higher in patients infected with human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) than in patients with no infection (
appendix
). Inflammation-induced endothelial cell injury could result in massive release of plasminogen activators, which could explain the high concentrations of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in patients with severe COVID-19.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is typically caused by pathologically enhanced platelet-vessel wall interaction due to ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. These multimers are released from perturbed endothelial cells and are under normal circumstances cleaved by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13). In many severe inflammatory states, upon systemic infection a secondary deficiency of ADAMTS13 has been established. Currently, there are no data on ADAMTS13 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

The coagulation changes associated with COVID-19 suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state that might increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Immobilisation and vascular damage are other factors that can increase the risk of thrombosis. Patients with COVID-19 have anecdotally been reported to have had pulmonary embolism, suggesting that there could be a disproportionately high incidence of venous thromboembolism and possibly arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. In critically ill patients, the incidence of thromboembolic complications ranges from 5% to 15% (
appendix
). Initial cohort studies show that the incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 is 35-45% (
appendix
).

done in China that included 449 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 infection showed a lower mortality in patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who received prophylactic heparin than in patients not receiving anticoagulant treatment (40 [40%] of 99 patients
vs
224 [64%] of 350 patients, p=0*029) in the subgroup of patients with a high sepsis-induced coagulopathy score. In particular, in patients with increased concentrations of D-dimer (6 times the upper limit of normal), mortality was lower in heparin-treated patients than those not treated with heparin. These results need to be interpreted with caution, as heparin treatment was not random and the conclusions were drawn from multiple post-hoc, subgroup analyses. A prospective randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of prophylactic heparin for the prevention of COVID-19-assocated coagulopathy is warranted to confirm these results.

Using the available evidence, we suggest monitoring coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19 by measuring prothrombin time, platelet count, and D-dimer concentrations every 2-3 days (
panel
).

There is evidence supporting the use of prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. In view of the hypercoagulable state of patients with severe COVID-19, and the potential increased risk of thrombosis, we suggest that all patients with COVID-19 that are admitted to hospital should receive this prophylactic treatment in the absence of medical contraindications. If LMWH is not available, unfractionated heparin could be used, although this requires more frequent injections; an alternative is fondaparinux, but whether this drug has the postulated anti-inflammatory benefits of heparin is unclear. Patients with severe COVID-19 might need higher-dose thromboprophylaxis than is generally given because of their hypercoagulable state, and this hypothesis will be tested in several multicentre, randomised, controlled trials (

Consider venous thromboembolism in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and high D-dimer concentrations

*

Do CT angiography or ultrasound of the venous system of the lower extremities

*

If diagnostic testing is not possible and there are no bleeding risk factors, consider therapeutic anticoagulation

*

Other interventions (such as plasma exchange, or administration of other anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory drugs) are experimental and should be considered in a clinical trial setting only

Preliminary observations suggest that in patients with high D-dimer concentrations and a sudden deterioration of respiratory insufficiency, pulmonary embolism should be part of the differential diagnosis. This diagnosis should be confirmed by imaging, although in some very unstable patients this might be difficult. Alternatively, venous ultrasound of the legs can be helpful to identify lower extremity thrombosis. In patients with a strong suspicion of pulmonary embolism in whom no objective diagnosis can be obtained, therapeutic anticoagulation could be started, particularly in the absence of risk factors for bleeding or other contraindications for anticoagulation. Of note, the incidence of haemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19, even those with severe coagulopathy, appear to be low.

Other anticoagulant modalities have not yet been systematically studied in patients with COVID-19 and cannot be advocated at this point. Plasma exchange could be helpful as a treatment of thrombotic microangiopathy by delivering high volumes of plasma, replenishing missing factors (eg, ADAMTS-13 or complement proteins) and removing excess inflammatory mediators; however, this treatment needs to be further evaluated in a controlled trial setting.

Abstract

Background/Objectives

There has been a recent marked increase in pediatric and adult patients presenting with purpuric acral lesions concerning for ischemia, thrombosis and necrosis in COVID-19 prevalent regions worldwide. The clinical and histopathological features and relationship to COVID-19 have not been well described. The objective of this case series is to describe the clinical features and determine the histopathologic findings and clinical implications of the clusters of acral perniosis cases identified in pediatric patients.

Methods

We describe 6 otherwise healthy adolescents - 3 siblings per family from 2 unrelated families - presented within a 48-hour period in April, 2020, with acral perniosis-like lesions in the context of over 30 similar patients who were evaluated within the same week.

Results

Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1-2 weeks preceding the rash. They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes. Skin biopsies performed on each of the 6 patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis. While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure.

Conclusion

We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction: A novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus able to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been recently recognized as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which has spread rapidly from China to other countries. Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. Material and Methods: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. Results: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL;
p
= 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%;
p
= 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50);
p
= 0.0003). Conclusion: Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.

Abstract:
Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its
assessment of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Effective therapeutic drugs are
urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis of patients, but currently no such
drugs are available.
Methods Patients in the study were divided into a heparin and a control group based
on whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used. D-dimer, C-reactive
protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage, interleukin-6, and other
indices in 42 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia were retrospectively
analyzed to compare and evaluate the progress of patients before and after LMWH
treatment.
Results Compared to the control group, D-dimer levels in the heparin group
significantly increased before treatment, and there was no significant difference after
treatment. There was no significant difference in the change of CRP levels between
the two groups of patients before and after LMWH treatment, and levels for both
groups were significantly lower after, compared to before, treatment. Compared to the
control group, patients in the heparin group had a higher percentage of lymphocytes
after treatment and lower levels of interleukin-6; these differences were statistically
significant.
Conclusions Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH can improve
hypercoagulability, inhibit IL-6 release, and counteract IL-6 biological activity in
patients. LMWH has potential antiviral effects and can help delay or block
inflammatory cytokine storms. It can also increase the lymphocytes (LYM%)of
patients and has the potential for treatment of COVID-19.
Introduction
Coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
virus that causes common colds and severe respiratory diseases, 1such as Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS)2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)2. In
December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases appeared in Wuhan, Hubei

Province, China, and their clinical manifestations suggested viral pneumonia.4 Deep
sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel coronavirus named
SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it caused was named COVID-19.5 Its clinical
manifestations include fever, cough, sputum, chest distress or asthma, fatigue,
myalgia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.6,7,8 Severe cases may progress rapidly to
acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, septic shock, coagulopathy,
and organ failure (e.g., liver, kidneys, and heart), which all pose a serious threat to
human health.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared its assessment of
COVID-19 as a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a long incubation
period, high infectivity, and multiple routes of transmission.9,10 According to real-time
WHO statistics, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of
March 28, 2020 has exceeded 600,000, with more than 28,000 deaths. However, no
effective medicines are currently available, and it can only be treated symptomatically.
As the worldwide patient base continues to expand and the number of severely and
critically ill patients increases rapidly, determining the mechanism through which
patients progress from mild to severe and from severe to critical is the main avenue
for discovering effective treatment strategies.
Lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms are typical abnormalities observed in
highly pathogenic coronavirus infections (such as SARS and MERS),12 and are
believed to be associated with disease severity.12,13,14 Multiple studies have shown that
cytokine storms are important mechanisms of disease exacerbation and death in
patients with COVID-19.12,13,14 IL-6 levels are significantly higher in severely ill
patients with COVID-19 compared to those with mild cases.15 A cytokine storm may
occur when cytokines reach a certain threshold in the body.16 Reducing the release or
activity of IL-6 can prevent or even reverse the cytokine storm syndrome caused by
the virus, thereby improving the condition of patients with COVID-19.
In recent years, a large number of studies have revealed that low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) has various non-anticoagulant properties that play an
anti-inflammatory role by reducing the release and biological activity of IL-6.17,18,19

However, the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH in COVID-19 are not currently
known. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective cohort study, to
analyze the relieving effect of LMWH in patients with COVID-19. This study aims to
review and analyze the treatment course of patients with COVID-19 to investigate the
anti-inflammatory effects of heparin and delay disease progression to provide
guidance for subsequent clinical practice.
Methods
Research subjects
All cases in this study were located at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College,
Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China), a

Data collection
Basic patient information collected in this study from electronic medical records
included complete blood count, coagulation function, cytokines, serum biochemical
tests (including liver function, kidney function, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive
protein (CRP), and electrolytes), and disease progression. Two researchers also
independently reviewed the data collected forms to double check the data collected.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical software. Data were
expressed as mean +- standard deviation (SD). GraphPad 6.0 software was used for
plotting. Differences between groups were evaluated using the T-test for measurement
data, the chi-square test for count data, and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test
between groups (independent samples) and within groups (related samples).
Differences of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
General characteristics of patients with COVID-19
As shown in Table 2, the heparin group consisted of 13 males and eight females aged
between 42 and 91 years (median age was 69.0 years), and the control group consisted
of 14 males and seven females aged between 40 and 84 years (median age was 69.0
years); there was no significant difference between the two groups. There were no
significant differences in comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and carcinomas, between the two groups. Similarly, there were
no significant differences in novel coronavirus pneumonia onset symptoms, including
fever (body temperature >= 37.3degC), cough, sputum, chest distress or asthma, myalgia,
fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. Similarly, there was no
significant difference in antiviral treatment between the two groups. These results
indicate that the general characteristics of the two groups of patients were consistent
and comparable.
LMWH has no effect on the days to conversion to negative and the duration of
hospitalization of patients with COVID-19
As shown in Table 2, the number of days to conversion to negative (time from

hospitalization to virus shedding) was 20.0 days (IQR 11.0-31.0) in the heparin group
and 19.0 days (IQR 12.0-30.0) in the control group (p = 0.46); the difference between
the two groups was not significant. Similarly, the length of hospital stay was 29.0
days (IQR 17.0-42.0) in the heparin group and 27.0 days (IQR 24.0-31.0) in the
control group (p = 0.41); the difference between the two groups was not significant.
Notably, all patients showed improvement after treatment.
Effect of LMWH on Blood routine in patients with COVID-19
As shown in Figure 2A-F, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte
percentage between the heparin and control groups before and after LMWH treatment.
However, patients in the heparin group had a significantly increased percentage of
lymphocytes after LMWH treatment. In addition, the changes in lymphocyte
percentages in patients in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were
significantly different to those in the control group. The results suggest that LMWH
increases lymphocyte percentage in patients with COVID-19, indicating that LMWH
has some anti-inflammatory effects.
Compared with the control group, platelets were significantly increased after LMWH
treatment. Similarly, the changes in platelet levels before and after LMWH treatment
in the heparin group were significantly different from those in the control group.
However, there was no significant difference in RBC, WBC, neutrophil% and
monocyte% levels between the two groups.
Effect of LMWH on coagulation function in patients with COVID-19
As shown in Figure 2G-N, before patients were administered LMWH, the levels of
D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in patients in the heparin group
were significantly higher compared to those in the control group, indicating that these
patients may have been in a hypercoagulable state. After the administration of LMWH,
D-dimer and FDP levels in the heparin group significantly decreased, and there was
no significant difference with the control group. The D-dimer and FDP levels of
patients in the heparin group before and after LMWH administration were
significantly different. The results indicate that LMWH improves the hypercoagulable
state in patients with COVID-19. However, there was no significant difference in TT,

APTT, PT, FIB, ATIII and INR levels between the two groups.
Effect of LMWH on CRP in patients with COVID-19
As shown in Figure 2O, there were no significant differences in CRP levels between
the two groups of patients before and after LMWH treatment, and both were
significantly lower compared to before treatment. Similarly, there were no significant
differences in CRP levels between the two groups of patients.
Effect of LMWH on cytokines in patients with COVID-19
To further investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH, we performed
statistical analyses on the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the two groups (Figure
3). There were no significant differences between the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10,
TNF-a, and IFN-g in the heparin group and those of the control group before and after
LMWH treatment. Similarly, the changes in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a, and IFN-g
levels were not significantly different between the two groups.
Notably, there was no significant difference in IL-6 levels between the heparin and
control groups before LMWH treatment. After LMWH treatment, IL-6 levels in the
heparin group were significantly reduced compared to the control group. Similarly,
the changes in IL-6 levels in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment
were significantly different to those in the control group. The results suggest that the
anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH may be associated with the reduction of IL-6
levels in patients with COVID-19.
Discussion
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared its assessment of COVID-19 as a global
pandemic. Although its case fatality rate is only 2.27%,12 the number of severely and
critically ill patients is increasing rapidly as the global patient base continues to
expand. Studies have shown that cytokine storms are associated with deterioration in
several infectious diseases, including SARS and avian influenza.20 Cytokine storms
are an important mechanism of exacerbation in patients.21 In recent years, numerous
studies have revealed that heparin has various non-anticoagulant properties. LMWH
can exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the release and biological activity of
IL-6. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin in COVID-19 are not yet

known. The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first retrospective
cohort study to analyze the relieving effect of LMWH in patients with COVID-19.
This study aims to review and analyze the treatment course of the patients to
investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin and delay COVID-19 disease
progression to provide guidance for subsequent clinical practice.
Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) can act as a bridge between vascular wall endothelial
tissue and platelets, promoting platelet adhesion.Previous studies have shown that
VWF level increased22 and platelet level decreased23 in SARS-CoV patients,
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote the process of platelet
thrombogenesis, thereby activating the subsequent coagulation cascade. At the same
time, studies have shown that LMWH is not easily inactivated by Platelet Factor
4(PF4)24,25, and has a strong affinity with VWF, which can prevent the interaction
between VWF and platelet26,27, significantly reduce the release of VWF28 by platelet
and endothelial cells, and reduce platelet aggregation and consumption. In the
difference analysis of this study, the mean difference of platelet count in heparin
group and control group was 5.57, -52.48(P < 0.05), which was consistent with the
results of the above study.
Clinical observations have shown that nearly 20% of patients with COVID-19 have
coagulopathy, including nearly all severe and critically ill patients.7,29 Studies have
shown that IL-6 and IL-8 can cause hypercoagulation, leading to scattered fibrin clots,
shortening the clot dissolution time and maximum dissolution rate,30 which suggests
that the hypercoagulation status of COVID-19 patients may be related to the body
increased cytokine levels. In previous studies of patients with COVID-19, D-dimer
levels were significantly elevated in patients admitted to the ICU with severe cases.31
The research of Ning Tang et al. showed higher levels of d-dimer and FDP in fatal
cases,32 but Li et al. believe that while monitoring for venous thromboembolism, the
correlation between D-dimer and COVID-19 severity must be considered.33 However,
there is currently no conclusive evidence supporting the use of D-dimer as an
evaluation index.34.35.36 A large sample analysis is required to determine whether
D-dimer is associated with COVID-19 severity. Therefore, the present study does not

consider this parameter as an evaluation index for disease progression. The average
values of d-dimer and FDP before treatment was greater in the heparin group than in
the control group (3.75,1.23,P < 0.01;14.35,4.05,P < 0.01). This result is consistent
with the goals of LMWH treatment in the heparin group. The analysis of differences
showed that LMWH has a better effect on lowering D-dimer and FDP levels.
Several studies have recommended CRP and lymphocytes (LYM%)as indices for
evaluating the effectiveness of clinical drugs or treatments.37,38,39 In the analysis of
differences in the present study, there was no statistically significant difference in
CRP between the groups, indicating that LMWH treatment has no effect on this
parameter. In the analysis of differences of LYM%, the mean value of the heparin
group was higher than that of the control group (11.10% and 3.08%, respectively).
LYM% was higher in the heparin group after treatment compared to the control group
(p < 0.001), which is consistent with the results of Derhaschnig et al.40 This suggests
that LMWH can increase LYM% in patients with COVID-19 and improve their
condition. There are two possible reasons for this; on one hand, LMWH is a
glycosaminoglycan41that partially inhibits the SARS-related coronavirus strain
HSR1.42 Mycroft-West et al. also showed that LMWH can bind to the SARS-CoV-2
surface protein (Spike) S1 Receptor Binding Domain and block the replication of the
virus, thus, showing potential antiviral effects.43 Additionally, LMWH can reduce
lymphocyte death caused by the direct viral infection of lymphocytes.13 On the other
hand, preliminary research has confirmed that proinflammatory cytokines, such as
TNFa and IL-6, can induce lymphopenia.14 Therefore, decreases in the number or
activity of relevant inflammatory factors may have some significance for the increase
in LYM%.
Studies have shown that cytokine storms are important mechanisms of exacerbation in
patients.21 IL-6 levels in severely ill patients with COVID-19 are significantly higher
than in patients with mild cases,15 and a cytokine storm may occur when cytokines
reach a certain threshold in the body.16 The transition from a mild to severe condition
in patients with COVID-19 may be caused by cytokine storms. Reducing IL-6 release

virus,44 thereby improving the condition of patients with COVID-19. LMWH has a
number of non-anticoagulant properties.45 Multiple studies have shown that LMWH
may reduce the release of IL-6 in the body by regulating plasma AT46 or APC47 levels
and inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB).17,18,19 In the present study,
we performed statistical analysis of the levels of inflammatory cytokines in two
groups of patients, and the results showed that IL-6 significantly decreased in the
heparin group compared to the control group, whereas the changes in other
inflammatory factors were not statistically significant; these results are consistent with
the conclusions above. In addition, a study by Mummery et al. found that LMWH can
bind to IL-6, competitively reduce the binding of IL-6 to SIL-6R and sgp130,48 and
block signal transduction, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of IL-6. This
indicates that LMWH reduces the release of IL-6 while also reducing its biological
activity, which also explains the increase of LYM% in the heparin group.
The present study found that under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH
could improve hypercoagulability, inhibit IL-6 release, and inhibit IL-6 biological
activity in patients. LMWH has potential antiviral effects, helps delay or block
inflammatory cytokine storms, increases LYM%, and may be suitable for COVID-19
treatment. In addition, to further confirm the conclusions of this study, we conducted a
prospective clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin sodium in
the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 ( Chinese Clinical Trial
Registry,number:chiCTR2000030700), with the expectation of providing a more
powerful reference for treatment.
Limitations:
This study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective design, we were unable
to control the time intervals between examinations of various indices in patients and
the LMWH dosing schedule, and we could not estimate the effective dose and timing
of LMWH. Second, there were no critical cases in the two groups of patients in the
trial; the treatment outcome of all cases was improvement and discharge and there
were no deaths. Therefore, the reference value for the treatment outcomes of critically
ill patients was limited. Finally, the sample size and single-center design may have

Clinical observation and management of COVID-19 patients

ABSTRACT

ABSTRACT

Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients. For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient.

Since late 2019 to early 2020, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, among the general human population in the City of Wuhan, caused by the transmission of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [
1
,
2
], has led to over 80,000 diagnosed cases including more than 3000 deaths globally as of 29 February 2020. While the overall mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 seems lower than SARS or MERS, the death rate among severe cases infected by SARS-CoV-2 is alarming. There are a wide range of efforts to develop special treatments for COVID-19 with limited success. In the current commentary, EMI invited three leading infectious disease experts in China who have personally participated in the clinical management of COVID-19 cases to share their bedside observations and to suggest what may be important in formulating the treatment strategy to optimize the clinical outcome.

Professor Taisheng Li (being sent to Wuhan from Beijing to provide frontline care to the COVID-19 cases in a local hospital)

Since 7 February 2020, my colleagues and I went to work in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Zhongfa Xincheng Hospital, part of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not high, due to the widespread of the disease, the total number of deaths is not small. Based on my observations in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients in the ICU, I propose that the early intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy are very important.

Clinical course of COVID-19

When SARS-CoV-2 infects a person, the lesions are not limited to the lungs. The virus causes viraemia after entering the body and the main clinical manifestations are fever, pharyngalgia, fatigue, diarrhoea and other non-specific symptoms [
3
,
4
]. This process includes the incubation phase and the early phase of the disease. The incubation takes 1-14 days (3-7 days being common). Peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphocytes are not significantly reduced (normal or slightly lower) at this phase. Then, the viruses spread through the bloodstream and mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart, presumably concentrated in the tissues expressing ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This phase occurs around 7-14 after the onset of the symptoms when the virus starts a second attack, which is also the main cause of the aggravation of symptoms. At this time, pulmonary lesions became worse, and chest CT scans show imaging changes consistent with COVID-19. At this stage, the peripheral blood lymphocytes decrease significantly, involving both T and B lymphocytes. Inflammatory factors in peripheral blood are increased.

Abnormal coagulation status

Patients at this phase will begin to develop the hypercoagulable state and D-Dimer-based coagulation factors may appear abnormal. The use of IVIG at this time may provide patients with effective clinical benefits and inhibit the formation of inflammatory factors storm (""cytokine storm""). LWMH therapy, suggested by colleagues at the Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, may also alleviate the hypercoagulable state in patients. During the development of dyspnoea and chest imaging changes from light to severe, the D-dimer increased from mild to significant, along with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and gradual decrease of fibrinogen (FBG) and platelet. Recently, it has been observed that some of the non-survivors suffered from ischaemic changes such as ecchymosis of the fingers and toes (
Figure 1
), at the same time as the organ functions of the heart and kidneys became worse. The above manifestations are consistent with the diagnosis of the hypercoagulable phase of DIC. It is believed that COVID-2019 can activate coagulation cascade through various mechanisms, leading to severe hypercoagulability. Early anticoagulation may block clotting formation and reduce microthrombus, thereby reducing the risk of major organ damages [
5
,
6
].

Considering the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, the possible effective medications are in dire need to improve the prognosis of the patients and to stem the spread of the virus. More than 200 clinical trials have been organized mainly for the study of anti-viral drugs including Kaletra, Remdesivir, Arbidol, Favipiravir, Chloroquine, HCQ, Darunavir, Lianhua Qingwen Granules and Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid. While the clinicians are enthusiastic about exploring the efficacy of these drugs, these trials are subject to all kinds of practical limitations. The majority of the trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature. For instance, a dozen clinical trials on Chloroquine have been carried out. Furthermore, due to the difference in design methodology, contradictory results may arise. The World Health Organization (WHO) has shown deep concern over the quality of these clinical trials and has provided guidance. A multitude of domestic experts also contributed their wisdom in different ways.

Research design

What we are faced with is a newly discovered viral disease, testing drugs are selected mainly based on the past experience of such drugs treating other related diseases. Some of them only had in vitro tests. Some hasn't finished Phase II clinical trials. Large-scale clinical trials will take a long time. Therefore, the small-scale clinical trials, including Phase II clinical trials, are currently given priority to, in which case, its effect, proper dosage, the medication and adverse reaction are initially verified. Those possibly effective and relatively safe medications can be coordinated to the large-scale and multi-centre clinical trials. In this way, a bulk of repetitive trials are avoided.

Another reality situation is the fact that the National COVID-19 Treatment Guideline has been updated quite urgently to include possibly effective drugs and experts are continuously offering new medical suggestions. Therefore, the medical workers in clinical trials usually take consideration of national guideline and expert opinion, while carrying out the trial under the premise that the normal treatment is not affected. As a result, the intervention group may be covered by a variety of anti-viral medications. It is difficult to leave the control group blank in order to confirm the absolute effect of the testing drug in the intervention group. The specific effects of the testing medication cannot be verified. In this case, the current clinical studies are not as rigorous as the traditional clinical trials, but they help draw a quick initial result which can help with the following study design. It is of vital importance to motivate the quick publication of clinical trial results, which can contribute significantly to clinical treatment.

Traditional Chinese medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine, after a long history of clinical use, has carved out its own theory and practice. The most typical ones are the ""Doctrine of Shanghai"" (febrile diseases caused by exogenous pathogenic factors) and the ""Doctrine of Seasonal Febrile Diseases."" In the diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infectious diseases like SARS and influenza, traditional Chinese medicine has played a significant role. But its treatment determination is based on ""Syndrome Differentiation,"" in which case, individual plans are produced. The Chinese medicine formulae are typical of complicated chemical compositions. This means that a creative evaluation system of traditional Chinese medicine needs to be developed.

Since late January, I have been working to ensure the high-quality care of COVID-19 patient by building a highly experienced clinician team, Shanghai Clinical Treatment Expert Group, based on group members' clinical and scientific expertise to provide the advice to complicated clinical management.

A team approach to manage COVID-19 patients

Currently, there have been more than 330 laboratory-confirmed adult cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai [
7
]. Most patients (>90%) are in mild or moderate states, and more than 90% of them have been cured and discharged by now. Because no specific drugs have been shown with clear effectiveness in helping the human body to clear the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the disease severity rate in Shanghai (26 cases, around 9-10%) actually objectively reflected the natural history of the disease, and was comparable with the severity rate at other places outside Hubei Province. All critically ill patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, and six patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We found that in addition to the involvement of the respiratory system, critically ill patients often had systemic involvement of multiple organs, including the heart, kidney, and coagulation system in the early disease course. Sometimes multiple system involvement was observed even at the time of initial hospital admission. Therefore, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial.

Every critically ill COVID-19 patient in Shanghai is managed by a group of healthcare providers which includes at least a pulmonologist, an infectious diseases expert, a critical care specialist, and an ECMO specialist if necessary. Nephrologists, psychiatrists, physicians of traditional Chinese medicine, experienced nurses also actively participate in managing these patients as well. Besides, substantial heterogeneity among severe patients was noted. Mild patients are more alike, but each severe case is severe in his/her own way. There may be multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in these critically ill patients. The types of critically ill patients need to be more carefully classified in order to perform more individualized treatment, in addition to conducting more dedicated research to develop a unique management plan. In Shanghai, medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each severe patient.

Early and effective treatment of mild cases is critical

The overall mortality rate is about 0.9% in Shanghai. However, we have found that once the disease course progressed to the critical illness state (requiring mechanical ventilation), the prognosis of the patients would become significantly worse. From this perspective, treatments that can prevent mild state from progressing to the severe or critical state will significantly improve the overall prognosis of the clinical courses. Such effective treatments include intermittent short-term haemofiltration (ISVVH), low-dose short-course glucocorticoids therapy, among other approaches. The use of glucocorticoids is rather controversial and there is no general agreement by now. Based on our experiences, stably mild patients could self-manage the infection effectively and corticosteroid would not be recommended for them considering its potential risks. For patients who have an overly exuberant inflammatory response or are at high risk of developing ARDS, early-start of corticosteroids could be helpful. The benefit of corticosteroids as rescue treatment remains doubtful.

1
Since then, the spread of covid-19 has increased exponentially, with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic on 11 March.
2
By 15 April, more than 1 900 000 cases and 123 000 deaths had been reported worldwide.
3

Severe acute respiratory illness with fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath, comprise the working case definition used to select people for viral testing. This strategy captures typical symptomatic presentation, but imperfectly identifies unusual manifestations, such as patients without respiratory symptoms or only very mild symptoms. One widely cited modelling study concluded that up to 86% of cases might have been missed in China,
4
and reports of patients with unusual presenting symptoms are rising worldwide.

Non-respiratory symptoms

Case series report gastrointestinal symptoms in 2-40% of patients,
5
6
and diarrhoea can be the initial manifestation of infection.
7
Whether SARS-CoV-2 leads to such symptoms directly by infecting the gastrointestinal tract, indirectly by neurological involvement,
8
or through production of cytokines remains unknown. Viral RNA has been detected in stool samples, sometimes at high levels.
9
This raises the possibility of faecal-oral transmission,
10
which would have clear implications for infection control.

Taste or olfactory disorders were noted in up to 53% of the cases in a small cohort from Italy,
11
and new anosmia is being proposed as a criterion for testing, especially in young people with few other symptoms.
12
In one woman with covid-19, magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral inflammatory obstruction of the olfactory clefts
13
with no abnormalities of olfactory bulbs and tracts. Complete characterisation of patients with covid-19 and anosmia needs further research, however, as this usually transient observation is described after many respiratory viral infections.
12
Animal models indicate that coronaviruses might track into the brain via the olfactory nerve or bulb or both, causing neuronal damage or death.
14

Recent case series from China and the US describe other neurological symptoms among patients with covid-19, including ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, dizziness, headache, musculoskeletal disturbance, altered mental state, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or acute necrotising encephalopathy, without proof of direct viral invasion into the brain.
15
16
17
Systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered in patients with acute neurological events during the pandemic.

Cardiovascular events that have been associated with covid-19 in preliminary observations include myocardial injury, especially in patients with severe infections,
18
myocarditis
19
and myopericarditis with reduced systolic function ,
20
21
cardiac arrhythmias,
22
heart failure, and misdiagnosis as acute coronary syndrome. Covid-19 was associated with a hypercoagulable state in a retrospective cohort study from China, probably increasing the risk for venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolus.
23
Chest pain should therefore alert clinicians to the possibility of covid-19.

Finally, ocular manifestations such as conjunctival hyperaemia, chemosis, and increased secretions, were reported in up to 32% of infected patients in a Chinese case series, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in tears.
24

Diagnosis might be particularly complicated in specific populations: children frequently have milder disease than adults, with few or no symptoms.
25
It's not yet clear why SARS-CoV-2 may minimally infect children, lead to asymptomatic infection, or give rise to atypical symptoms that are missed by the conventional case definition.

Infectious diseases might be harder to identify in older people, whose symptoms could be masked. A mild pneumonia might cause only fever, a fall, or confusion, leading to misdiagnosis. Diagnostic delay has serious consequences for older adults, including increased mortality and nosocomial transmission.
26
The threshold for testing should be lowered in this vulnerable group.

Few or no symptoms

Risk of transmission by people with few or no symptoms remains to be quantified. Case reports indicate that runny nose or sore throat can be isolated symptoms.
30
Testing strategies that exclude patients with few symptoms are likely to miss a substantial proportion of cases.

Similar viral loads have been documented in the upper respiratory tract of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases
27
and in the presymptomatic phase.
28
In one quarantined cruise ship, up to 50% of positive cases were asymptomatic or presymptomatic at the time of testing.
29

Available evidence from observational and modelling reports indicates that up to 12% of transmission occurs before an index case develops symptoms.
31
32
This has important implications for the effectiveness of any testing strategy and for contact tracing and containment measures. To curtail active transmission of SARS-CoV-2, testing should be extended far beyond people who fit a narrow case definition and other populations currently considered at risk. The current strategy will not capture the full picture, missing a substantial number of patients with atypical presentations or few symptoms. Worse, restrictive testing criteria could lead to unrecognised cases transmitting the virus in healthcare settings or the community and to delays in appropriate patient triage and management.

Broad population screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections, isolation of confirmed cases through contact tracing and quarantine combined with social distancing, and large serological studies will be critical to slowing the spread of covid-19.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.

Research Highlights

83.7% of the patients had contact history in Wuhan or had been to Wuhan or had contact with people from Wuhan.

Common symptoms included fever, cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia, etc.

Common complications of the patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infection and shock. ICU patients were more likely to have these complications than non-ICU patients.

All patients received antiviral therapy (kaletra or interferon), antibacterial therapy and corticosteroid and many received traditional chinese medicine. It was suggested that patients should use kaletra early.

1 INTRODUCTION

An outbreak of a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause that began in Wuhan, China has continued since December 2019. This illness is reported to have affected more than 79 602 people so far (74 680 confirmed, 4922 suspected, 16 646 cured, and 2122 deaths). In addition to Hubei, Wanzhou, Chongqing ranks third in infection rates among all of the cities in the provinces of China. A literature review was performed, and it was found that there have been no studies regarding the characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Chongqing. Clinically, the disease is characterized by fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and fatigue. Upper-respiratory tract symptoms are not prominent, but diarrhea was reported by some patients. Pulmonary imaging has shown multiple ground glass and infiltrative shadows in both lungs. Severe cases have been shown to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. On 7 January 2019, scientists successfully isolated the pathogen that causes the pneumonia, a new type of b-coronavirus, and it was named 2019-nCoV.
1
Subsequently, WHO named it coronavirus disease (COVID-19). An epidemiological survey showed that the first occurrence of COVID-19 patients was closely related to a seafood market in south China. Due to the ""Spring Festival Movement"" (known as the ""annual migration of the population in China""), COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout the country, and the number of infected people gradually increased. The spread of COVID-19 among people has been confirmed to occur through multiple channels, such as droplets, aerosols, feces, and mouth mucus membranes.
1

The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in northeast Chongqing. It is hoped that these findings will assist the global community to more clearly understand and treat this new infectious disease.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and participants

This case series was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital (also named Three Gorges Central Hospital, No: 2020-2). All of the patients were from northeast Chongqing admitted to the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital from 23 January to 8 February 2020 with subsequent confirmed cases of COVID-19. A total of 135 patients were enrolled in this study. Oral consent was obtained from all of the patients. The Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital, located in northeast Chongqing, is a teaching hospital consisting of nine medical colleges and universities, including the Third Military Medical University, the Southwest Medical University, and the North Sichuan Medical College. This facility is responsible for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as assigned by the government. All of the patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance
2
and were jointly diagnosed by a multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment team composed of infectious disease experts, respiratory medicine staff, critical care medical staff, and emergency medicine staff. The clinical outcomes (eg, discharge, mortality, and length of stay) were monitored from 8 February 2020 to the final date of follow-up.

2.2 Case collection

Clinical data of 135 COVID-19 patients were collected from 23 January 2020, when the first case in northeast Chongqing was found, to 8 February 2020. The research team collected the clinical data of patients using the electronic medical record system (HIS). General information included epidemiological histories, current medical histories, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory examination results, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations, treatment measures, complications, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and other parameters. The patients were divided into mild (including normal and mild) and severe (including severe and critical) groups. The mild group had mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging. The normal group had symptoms of fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging showed pneumonia. The severe group had respiratory distress, RR >= 30 beats/minute in a resting state, a mean oxygen saturation of <=93%, and an arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO
2
)/oxygen concentration (FiO
2
) <= 300 mm Hg. The critical group had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of shock, and the combined failure of other organs that required ICU monitoring and treatment.

2.4 Statistical analysis

The categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and the continuous variables were described using the mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. The continuous variables were compared using independent group
t
tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. The proportions of categorical variables were compared using a
kh
2
test. All of the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. For unadjusted comparisons, a two-sided
a
of less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant. The analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and given the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.

2.5 Presenting characteristics

Among the 135 hospitalized patients, 40 (29.6%) cases were divided into the severe group and 95 (70.4%) cases were divided into the mild group. The median age of all of the patients was 47 years (IQR, 36-55), and 72 (53.3%) cases were male. Compared to mild patients, severe patients were significantly older (median age 56 years [IQR, 52-73] vs 44 years [IQR, 33-49];
P
< .001) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes (9 [22.5%] vs 3 [3.1%]), cardiovascular disease (6 [15%] vs 1 [1%]), hypertension (4 [10%] vs 9 [9.4%], and malignancy (3 [7.5%] vs 1 [1%]) (Table
1
). A majority of 135 patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan (Figure
1
).

The epidemiology of the included COVID-19 patients. COVID-19, coronavirus disease

The most common symptoms and signs at the onset of illness were fever (120 [88.9%], primarily mild to moderate, 37.3degC-38.9degC: 70 [51.9%], 38.1degC-39degC: 37 [27.4%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), myalgia or fatigue (44 [32.5%]), and headache (24 [17.7%]). Less common symptoms were pharyngalgia (34 [25.2%]), dyspnea (18 [13.3%]), diarrhea (18 [13.3%]), chest tightness and shortness of breath (12 [8.8%]), fear of cold (14 [10.3%]), and sputum production (12 [8.8%]). The median time from first admission to transfer was 5 days (IQR, 5-13) (Table
2
).

According to Table
3
, the leukocyte counts of most of the patients were in the normal range, but the classified count showed that the lymphocyte counts of the severe patients (median = 0.8 x 10
9
/L) were significantly lower than that of the mild patients (median = 1.2 x 10
9
/L). Although the coagulation indexes of all of the patients were nearly in the normal range, the Pt, APTT, and
d
-dimer of the severe patients were higher than those of the mild patients. Compared to the mild patients, the level of albumin was lower in the severe patients (36 [33-38.5] vs 49.9 [37.4-43.6];
P
< .0001), and there was no significant difference in the level of alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of severe patients was significantly higher than those of the mild patients (309 [253.8-408.3] vs 212 [179.5-259];
P
< .0001). Indexes related to myocardial injury, such as creatine kinase, glutamic oxaloacetylase, LDH, and C-reactive protein (CRP), increased more significantly in the severe patients. Procalcitonin was higher in the severe patients than mild patients (0.11 [0.08-0.16] vs 0.04 [0.03-0.06];
P
< .0500).

Since nearly all of the patients with COVID-19 had cough as their main early symptom, a chest CT scan was performed in all of the suspected patients. The typical pulmonary changes in the imaging results were interstitial pneumonia with primarily bilateral involvement and multiple patchy, flocculent, or strip ground glass shadow. The marginal areas of the lesions were ill-defined. There was little pleural effusion, and consolidation of the lung occurred when the disease was serious (Figure
2
).

The character of the chest computed tomography (CT) scan in new coronavirus pneumonia patients. The letter ""l"" stands for ""lung window"", and ""m"" stands for ""mediastinal window"". The CT images were obtained at both lung and mediastinal window settings, showing the multiple patchy ground-glass density shadows on each leaf of the lungs, without bronchial obstruction and pleural effusion

2.6 Organ dysfunctions and primary interventions

Common complications of these 135 patients included ARDS (21 [15.6%]), acute cardiac injury (10 [7.4%]), acute kidney injury (5 [3.7%]), secondary infection (7 [5.1%]), and shock (1 [0.7%]). Severe patients were more likely to have these complications compared to mild patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]), and many patients received antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]) and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). Twenty-seven (67.5%) of the severe patients received noninvasive ventilation. One patient (2.5%) in the severe group was treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy was applied in most of the patients (124 [91.8%]). As of 8 February 2020, a total of 15 patients (11.1%) had been discharged, and one patient had died. The 28-day mortality rate was 2.5% (Table
4
). There was a significant difference between the severe group and the mild group in the number of people that had received antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids (
P
< .0001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who used TCM (
P
= .3220) (Table
4
). Actually, most of the patients were treated with a combination of Western and TCM. The application of TCM in viral pneumonia has accumulated rich experience. In recent years, the relevant research has shown that it has a good therapeutic effect on pneumonia.

3 DISCUSSION

To date, this report is the largest case series of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in northeast Chongqing. There was no significant difference in the proportion of male and female patients, and infection in children was rare, which was inconsistent with the results of a study performed by Zhong et al.
6
Their results showed that males were more likely to be infected than females.
6
A total of 83.7% of the patients included in this study had contact history in Wuhan, had been to Wuhan, or had contact with people from Wuhan, which again verified the conclusion of human to human transmission.
7
The primary symptoms were fever and cough, which agreed with the research results of Zhao et al.
8
,
9
Other symptoms included myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. COVID-19 patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhea), whereas about 20% to 25% of patients infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV experienced diarrhea.
10
The primary complications during hospitalization included ARDS, arrhythmia, and shock. Patchy shadows of the bilateral lungs and ground-glass shadow were typical CT signs of COVID-19. The most severe patients were older and had more basic diseases compared to mild patients.

According to the RNA detection results of COVID-19 patients in our hospital and the reports of other medical institutions, the sensitivity of the detection kit currently used in clinical is not ideal.
1
However, imaging of typical pulmonary changes was seen in a vast majority of the confirmed cases. The imaging of pulmonary changes due to COVID-19, like most viral pneumonias, was pleomorphic with interstitial changes and patchy and ground glass shadows.
11
The imaging of pulmonary changes was often out of step with the patient's symptoms and nucleic acid test results. The expert group from our hospital called this phenomenon the ""shadow-syndrome discrepancy."" Some mild patients often had no fever, cough, dyspnea, and other symptoms. In contrast, the symptoms were mild, and multiple nucleic acid tests were negative, but the CT showed a large ground glass area in the lung. Therefore, some clinicians have suggested that a CT examination should be the first choice in the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19, and it has been suggested that patients should have a chest CT scan every 3 to 5 days to understand the changes in the lung lesions to more accurately evaluate the condition.

CRP and procalcitonin of severe patients were significantly higher than those of mild patients, but bacterial culture results showed no growth after 5 days of aerobic and anaerobic culture, suggesting that although inflammatory factors had increased, there was no significant bacterial infection. The D-dimer concentration was increased in 135 patients, especially in severe patients. This indicated the presence of a hypercoagulable state and secondary hyperfibrinolysis in vivo. In most patients, the leukocyte count was in the normal range and lymphocyte count was generally reduced, which agreed with the recent research results published by academician Zhong et al.
6
This suggests that the virus may cause disease by attacking the immune system. LDH and aspartate aminotransferase generally increased, but the albumin of patients decreased. In addition, the changes in the severe patients were more obvious than the mild patients, suggesting that early liver function may be damaged in the mild patients, while liver damage in the severe patients was more obvious.

Among the 135 patients, only 1 patient died, and this case will be briefly discussed. He was a 52-year-old male with diabetes and a chronic disease, and his son had recently returned from Wuhan. His neutrophil,
d
-dimer count, lymphocyte, CD4
+
T, CD8
+
T, B cell, and NK cell counts were above normal levels. In addition, his CD4
+
T/CD8
+
T counts continued to decline until death (Table
5
). He eventually died of acute respiratory distress, oxygen saturation, and heart rate decline, which was consistent with the results of a study performed by Chen et al.
12
In addition, Wan et al
13
found that CD4
+
T and CD8
+
T were lower in severe patients, which suggested that lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients. Lymphocytopenia may be related to a cytokine storm caused by viral invasion. This suggests that we should pay more attention to the cellular immunity of patients and take comprehensive measures to treat patients so as to reduce mortality.

Currently, there are no specific treatment proposals for COVID-19 in China. At present, the primary measures to control this disease are early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatment for affected patients. In this study, all of the patients were treated with oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. In addition, many patients received antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]) and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]), and a few patients required invasive ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. According to a recent Korean scholar's report,
14
,
15
Kaletra was shown to be effective in the early treatment of COVID-19 patients, and the earlier Kaletra was used, the more significant the therapeutic effect. Their experience primarily came from the treatment of the MERS coronavirus in 2015, and they had established guidelines. Initially, only the severe patients were treated with Kaletra, and mild patients were not administered the drug in Wuhan, leading to a low patient cure rate. These results indicated that the application effect of Kaletra was not significant in severe patients. All of the patients in our hospital were treated with Kaletra in the early stage, with the belief that Kaletra may play a role in the inhibition of viral replication. Currently, there are 236 patients in our hospital, and 98 of them have been cured and discharged, for a cure rate of 41.5%. The therapeutic effect is obvious. Japan has also announced that they will conduct clinical trials using Kaletra on patients with COVID-19.

In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV,

17
MERS-CoV,

19
and COVID-19, 21 (52.5%) of the severe patients were treated with glucocorticoids to reduce inflammatory injury in the lungs. However, due to the limitations of existing evidence, use of glucocorticoids is still controversial. The latest clinical studies
20
have suggested that glucocorticoids should not be used to treat lung injury or shock caused by COVID-19 without clinical trials. However, some studies
2
,
21
,
22
have shown that the rational use of glucocorticoids could reduce the mortality of SARS patients with critical illness, shorten the length of stay, and not cause secondary infection and other complications. Therefore, glucocorticoids are suggested for treatment according to the ""Application Recommendations of Glucocorticoids for Corona Virus Disease 2019: Recommendations for the use of Glucocorticoids for the New Coronavirus Pneumonia"" issued by the Chinese Thoracic Society.
23

Since 2003, TCM has been utilized to fight SARS, H1N1H7N9, MERS, EBOV, and other viral diseases.
24
TCM has also been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ""New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan"" (trial version 5).
3
Chinese patent medicines used in the treatment of COVID-19 have primarily included: Reduning injection, Suhuang Zhike capsule, and Xuebijing. In addition, the Chinese herbals used to treat COVID-19 primarily include glycyrrhiza, ephedra, bitter almond, gypsum, reed root, amomum, and trichosanthes. TCM primarily functions to clear heat and remove toxicity, to remove heat from the lungs to relieve cough, and to increase immunity.
5

This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small compared to Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. In general, the number of patients in this area is in the middle level of the rest of the country, except for Wuhan. Therefore, the research results were reliable. Second, most of the 135 patients were still hospitalized at the end of this study. Therefore, it was difficult to evaluate the risk factors for a poor prognosis. Long-term observation is required.

In future research, a multicenter study will be established to expand the sample size and to conduct more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, the follow-up of patients who were cured and discharged will be conducted.

Method

Retrospective analysis is done on the clinical information of 292 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020, including 21 severe patients and 271 mild patients; the demographic features, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, laboratory examination and other indicators of the patients in the two groups are compared. The measurement data was compared with t test or Mann-Whitney U test; and counting data was compared with kh2 test. The risk factors leading to severe condition were analyzed with bivariate regression equation.

The COVID-19 patients admitted in Shanghai were mostly elder male patients, and mostly accompanied with underlying diseases. ALB, Mb, CRP, CD3+TLC and CD8+TLC could be taken as the early warning indicators for severe cases, requiring more clinical attention.

In December 2019, some pneumonia patients of unknown cause were found in Wuhan, Hubei, and investigators discovered a novel coronavirus in the lower respiratory tract samples from such patients, which was later named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1]. On February 11, WHO officially named the disease caused from 2019 novel coronavirus as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. By now, the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients are still increasing, including many severe and death cases, causing serious threat to the national economic development and health of people in China.

Most COVID-19 patients were mild patients (mild and common type), and the majority of them could be alleviated through the symptom-based support treatment, however, if it developed into the severe condition (severe or critical), the difficulty in treatment and the risk of death would increase significantly. The early identification and timely treatment of severe patients are the key to reducing the mortality of patients. As a designated hospital for treatment of COVID-19 patients, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center had admitted 292 confirmed COVID-19 patients as of February 10, 2020. The retrospective analysis was conducted for the medical information of 21 severe COVID-19 patients and 271 mild patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020, for investigating the risk factors leading to the severe condition, to provide further evidences for the early identification of severe cases and implementation of closer monitoring and more targeted interventions.

Subject and Method

Subject of study

292 confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020, including 21 severe COVID-19 patients and 271 mild patients. The criteria for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 were in accordance with
Guidelines on the Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment
(Version 5, Interim) [3], with the severe cases clinically classified into the severe case and the critical case, and the mild cases classified into the mild case and the common case. The respiratory samples of all cases were found to be positive with nucleic acid test. The study has been reviewed by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (YJ-2020-S015-01).

The statistic analysis was done by using SPSS 24.0 software. The measurement data meeting the normal distribution was expressed as +-s, the inter-group comparison was conducted with t test, and the corrected t test was adopted upon heterogeneity of variance; the measurement data not meeting the normal distribution was expressed as M (P25, P75), and the inter-group comparison was conducted with Mann-Whitney U test. The counting data was expressed with the cases (percentage), and the comparison was done with kh2 test. The variables with statistical significance after analysis of the inter-group variation were incorporated in the bivariate logistic regression equation, used for excluding the impact from mixed factors; the forward progressive regression method based on maximum likelihood estimate was chosen to screen out the independent risk factors that make COVID-19 patients become severe patients. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Current diagnosis of 21 severe COVID-19 patients

As of February 11, among 21 severe COVID-19 patients, there were 12 patients requiring high flow oxygen intake, 9 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 1 death case, with the severe case rate of 7.2% (21/292) and the severe case mortality of 4.8% (1/21). Other severe patients were still in the process of treatment.

Comparison between clinical data of severe patients and mild patients

Among 292 patients included in the study, there were 154 male patients (52.7%) and 138 female patients (47.3%), aged 49.9+-16.3; 256 married patients (87.7%), and totally 178 patients (61.0%) come from or visited Wuhan or other areas in Hubei before symptom development, and the interval from symptom development to hospitalization was 4.0 (2.0, 7.0) d. The severe COVID-19 patients were mostly married elderly female patients, with the male-female ratio of 9.5:1; while the mild patients were younger, with the male-female of 0.99:1, and the inter-group sex and age showed the statistical difference (P<0.01). 11 (52.4%) severe cases were accompanied with hypertension, diabetes, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, chronic renal diseases, hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis and other underlying diseases; 74 (27.3%) mild patients were accompanied with underlying diseases. The rate of having the infected spouse, children, parents other relatives in severe cases was higher than that in the mild patients, showing the statistical difference (kh2=4.744,P=0.029). The comparison between the intervals from symptom development of respiratory symptoms (fever and/or cough, etc.) to receiving treatment in the severe case group and the mild patient group showed no statistical difference (P=0.632). See Table 1.

To exclude the confounding factors, the binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of the parameters with statistical difference on the deterioration of the conditions of the mild patients and the severe patients at admission, the results indicated that the final logistic regression model had statistical significance (kh2=60.973,P<0.01). This model can correctly classify 95.7% of the subjects. This model had fairly good prediction of mild patients. The results indicated that 99.2% (261/263) of the patients in the mild group were correctly predicted, and 47.4% (9/19) of the severe patients could be identified by the model. Among those parameters, albumin, myoglobin, CRP, CD3+T lymphocyte count and CD8+T lymphocyte count are related to the severity of the patient's conditions and therefore are considered as the independent risk factors for the COVID-19 patients becoming severe patients (Table 3). On the other hand, parameters including gender, age, relative infection, underlying diseases, ANC (absolute neutrophils count), absolute lymphocyte count, ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, serum cystatin C, transferrin, procalcitonin, D-dimer, CD4+T lymphocyte count, B-type natriuretic peptide precursor, creatine kinase, CK-MB, serum troponin I were not included in the regression model.

Discussion

According to the report
Epidemic Update and Risk Assessment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus
published by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2,744 confirmed cases were reported in 30 provincial-level regions (including autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) by 24:00 on January 26, 2020, of which the male-to-female ratio was 1.16:1, the median age was 49 years old, and 16.8% (461/2744) were severe patients [4]. As of 24:00 on February 9, 2020, the overall confirmed cases had reached 35,982 in 31 provincial level regions (including autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, of which 6,484 were severe patients, accounting for 18% of the total [5]. Chen et al. [6] summarized the clinical data of 99 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The data indicated that the average age of the patients was 55.5 years old, 67 patients (68%) were male, 50 (51%) had underlying diseases, 23 (23%) severe patients were admitted to the ICU, and 11 of them died. Guan et al. [7] analyzed 1,099 confirmed cases, the median age was 47 years old, 59% of them were male, and 173 (15.7%) were severe patients. In this study, the severe case rate of the COVID-19 patients was 7.2% (21/292), lower than the results of all published studies available.

It was found through this study that most (90.5%) of the severe patients were middle-aged and elderly male, their ages were in between (65.5+-15.7), and 52.4% of them had underlying diseases. Among them, one patient died, and the case fatality rate of severe patients was 4.8%. Huang et al. [8] reported the clinical data of 41 COVID-19 patients who had been initially diagnosed. The data indicated that 13 (32%) of the severe patients were admitted to the ICU, similarly the majority of them were middle-aged and elderly male, the median age was 49 years old, the percentage of male patients was 85% (11/13), 38% (5) of them had underlying diseases, and 5 died, with a case fatality rate of 38%. In addition, Wang et al. [9] reported that among 138 patients with COVID-19, 36 (26%) were severe patients requiring the ICU admission, the age was 66 (57, 78) years old, 22 (61.1%) were male, 26 (72.2%) had underlying diseases, and the time from symptom development to admission was 8.0 (4.5, 10.0) days, which was similar to the results of this study. Eventually, 6 COVID-19 patients died, and the case fatality rate of severe patients was 16.7%, higher than that in this study. In a study of Guan et al. [7], the age of severe patients was 52 (40, 65) years old, including 100 male patients (47.8%), 65 patients (37.6%) had underlying diseases, and 14 died, with a case fatality rate of 8.1%. The fatality rate of severe COVID-19 patients in Shanghai included in this study is lower than the published results in other regions of China from the studies above. However, due to the small sample size included in this study, the final severity rate and fatality rate of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai area are still subject to further analysis, as many mild patients and severe patients are still in hospitals receiving treatment with potential changes with their conditions.

It was observed through this study that elderly male patients with underlying diseases and relatives infection in the severe group accounted for a higher percentage, compared with patients in the mild group, so there was statistical significance between the two groups. Wang et al. [9] also found that elderly severe patients with underlying diseases had a higher percentage, but there was no difference in gender composition. The study of Huang et al. [8] indicated that there was no statistical significance in age, gender and underlying diseases between the severe patients admitted to the ICU and the mild patients without the ICU admission. Guan et al. [7] found that those with elderly age, smoking habit, and underlying diseases accounted for a higher percentage among the severe patients.

In this study, the absolute neutrophils count of the severe patients was higher and that of the mild patients at admission, while their absolute lymphocyte count was opposite, this may be due to the susceptibility to bacterial infection when a patient was severely infected by 2019-nCoV. Compared with the mild patients, the severe patients had higher levels of ALT, AST, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), creatinine, serum cystatin C, and lower levels of albumin, suggesting that viral infection caused more obvious damage to the functions of the severe patients' organs like livers, kidneys, etc.. Severe patients' energy was consumed seriously and they had poor nutrient levels. Compared with the mild patients, the severe patients had higher levels of CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and lower levels of transferrin, indicating that the severe patients may have bacterial infection, and their bodies had a more obvious inflammatory response, resulting in hypercoagulable state. The CD3+T lymphocyte count, CD8+T lymphocyte count and CD4+T lymphocyte count of the severe patients were significantly lower than those of the mild patients, suggesting that the severe infection of 2019-nCoV might substantially inhibit the cellular immune function of the patients. Comparing the levels of myocardial injury indexes between the severe patients and the mild patients, it was observed that the severe patients had higher levels of creatine kinase, CK-MB, B-type natriuretic peptide precursor, serum troponin I, and serum myoglobin, indicating that myocardial injury caused by severe viral infection was more serious. Huang et al. [8] also found that the ICU patients had higher levels of PT, ALT, bilirubin, and cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-a, etc., than those who did not require the ICU admission. Wang et al. [9] found that severe patients had higher levels of white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, CK-MB, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, urea nitrogen, creatinine, troponin I and procalcitonin, and lower lymphocyte count level. In a study of Guan et al. [7], compared with the mild patients, the severe patients had higher percentage of white blood cell count >10 *109/L and <4 *109/L, lower platelet count and hemoglobin levels, higher levels of CRP and procalcitonin, and more abnormal liver and renal function indicators.

Although this study and previous reports have found that a number of clinical or laboratory test indicators have statistical significance between the severe patients and the mild patients, many of those indicators are not independent of each other, such as the positive correlation between peripheral blood total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte count, myocardial injury and pulmonary inflammation will lead to increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, there are many confounding factors. If simply using these indicators to predict clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 patients, the accuracy of the predication will be greatly compromised. In this regard, this study further excluded the effect of confounding factors by building a logistic regression equation. The results showed that the levels of albumin, myoglobin, CRP, CD3+T lymphocyte count and CD8+T lymphocyte count at admission of COVID-19 patients were correlated with the severity of the patients' conditions, which could be used as early warning indicators for the severe patients.

The results of this study indicated that clinically more attention should be paid to the changes of albumin, myoglobin, CRP, CD3+T lymphocyte count and CD8+T lymphocyte count with the COVID-19 patients at admission. If the patients have hypoalbuminemia, high CRP, CD3+T lymphocyte count and CD8+T lymphocyte count decrease, and other obvious cellular immune deficiency at admission, and present myocardial injury with typical indicator of increased myoglobin level, it is suggested that the patients may have a tendency to progress to severe conditions, and thus should be treated proactively and monitored closely in order to delay the development of the patients' conditions and reduce the fatality rate. However, given the fact that a limited number of cases were included in this study and that some severe patients had been already in critical conditions at admission, the actual predictive value of the relevant parameters for the development of COVID-19 patients still needs to further expanding the sample size, and prospective studies should be carried out to follow up the conditions with the mild patients and analyze their clinical outcomes, in order to verify the conclusions of this study.

We performed a literature search of electronically discoverable peer-reviewed publications on POCUS use in COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to April 10, 2020. We review key POCUS applications that are most relevant to frontline providers in the care of COVID-19 patients.

LUNG AND PLEURAL ULTRASOUND

Diagnosing COVID-19 disease by polymerase chain reaction is limited by availability of testing, delays in test positivity (mean 5.1 days), and high false-negative rate early in the course of the disease (sensitivity 81%).
2
Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are often requested during the initial evaluation of suspected COVID-19, but the American College of Radiology has recommend against the routine use of CT scans for diagnosing COVID-19.
3

The diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) has been shown to be similar to chest CT scans in patients presenting with respiratory complaints, such as dyspnea and hypoxemia, caused by non-COVID-19 pneumonia (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 93%).
4
Normal LUS findings correlate well with CT chest scans showing absence of typical ground glass opacities. This negative predictive value is very important.
5
However, early in the course of COVID-19, similar to CT scans, LUS may be normal during the first 5 days or in patients with mild disease.
2
Unique advantages of LUS in COVID-19 include immediate availability of results, repeatability over time, and performance at the bedside, which avoids transportation of patients to radiology suites and disinfection of large imaging equipment.

LUS findings in COVID-19 include (
a
) an irregular, thickened pleural line, (
b
) B-lines in various patterns (discrete and confluent), (
c
) small subpleural consolidations, and (
d
) absence of pleural effusions (Figure). Bilateral, multifocal disease is common, while lobar alveolar consolidation is less common.
6,7
In addition to supporting the initial diagnosis, LUS is being used to serially monitor hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As lung interstitial fluid content increases, discrete B-lines become confluent, and the number of affected lung zones increases, which can guide decisions about escalation of care. LUS is often used to guide decisions about prone ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and weaning from mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure of non-COVID-19 patients,
8
and these concepts are being applied to COVID-19 patients. During recovery, reappearance of A-lines can be seen, but normalization of the LUS pattern is gradual over several weeks based on our experience and one report.
9
Multiple LUS protocols examining 6 to 12 lung zones have been published prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend continuing to use an institutional protocol and evaluating at least one to two rib interspaces on the anterior, lateral, and posterior chest wall.

FOCUSED CARDIAC ULTRASOUND

Myriad cardiac complications have been described in COVID-19 - including acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy with heart failure, and arrhythmias - secondary to increased cardiac stress from hypoxia, direct myocardial infection, or indirect injury from a hyperinflammatory response. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.
10,11
Cardiac POCUS is being used to evaluate COVID-19 patients when troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated or when there are hemodynamic or electrocardiogram changes. Given the high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19,
12
cardiac POCUS is being used to rapidly assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and acute pulmonary hypertension.

The American Society of Echocardiography has recommended the use of cardiac POCUS by frontline providers for detection or characterization of preexisting cardiovascular disease, early identification of worsening cardiac function, serial monitoring and examination, and elucidation of cardiovascular pathologies associated with COVID-19.
13
Sharing cardiac POCUS images in real time or through an image archive can reduce the need for consultative echocardiography, which ultimately reduces staff exposure, conserves personal protective equipment, and reduces need for decontamination of echocardiographic equipment.

The minimum cardiac POCUS views recommended in COVID-19 patients include the parasternal long-axis and short-axis views (midventricular level), either the apical or subcostal four-chamber view, and the subcostal long-axis view of the inferior vena cava.
13
The goal of a cardiac POCUS exam is to qualitatively assess left ventricular (LV) systolic function, RV size and contractility, gross valvular and regional wall motion abnormalities, and pericardial effusion. In prone position ventilation, the swimmer's position with one arm elevated above the shoulder may permit acquisition of apical views. Finally, integrated cardiopulmonary ultrasonography, including evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT; see below), is ideal for proper characterization of underlying LV and RV function, volume status, and titration of vasopressor and inotropic support.

VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM

COVID-19 has been associated with a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state with elevated d-dimer and higher-than-expected incidence of VTE (27%) in critically ill patients.
12,14
Previous studies have demonstrated that frontline providers, including hospitalists, can detect lower extremity (LE) DVTs with high diagnostic accuracy using POCUS.
15
Given the high incidence of DVTs despite prophylactic anticoagulation, some reports have suggested screening or serially monitoring for LE DVT in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
16
In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), POCUS can rapidly detect venous thrombosis that justifies prompt initiation of anticoagulation (eg, finding DVT or clot-in-transit), supportive findings of PE (eg, acute RV dysfunction, pulmonary infarcts), or alternative diagnoses (eg, bacterial pneumonia). However, it is important to recognize POCUS cannot definitively rule out PE. Additionally, subpleural consolidations are common in COVID-19 patients and could be caused by either infection or infarction. The American Society of Hematology has endorsed the use of POCUS, LE compression ultrasonography, and echocardiography in COVID-19 patients with suspected PE when availability of CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion lung scans is limited.
14

A POCUS exam for LE DVT consists of two-dimensional venous compression alone and yields results similar to formal vascular studies in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients. Because proximal LE thrombi have the highest risk of embolization, evaluation of the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and popliteal vein is most important.
15
Either inability to compress a vein completely with wall-to-wall apposition or visualization of echogenic thrombus within the vein is diagnostic of DVT. Acute thrombi are gelatinous and may appear anechoic, while subacute or chronic thrombi are echogenic, but all veins with a DVT will not compress completely.

In COVID-19 patients, use of ultrasound guidance for vascular access has distinct advantages. First, given the high incidence of DVT in COVID-19 patients,
12
POCUS allows preprocedural evaluation of the target vessel for thrombosis, as well as anatomic variations and stenosis. Second, visualizing the needle tip and guidewire within the target vein prior to dilation nearly eliminates the risk of arterial puncture and inadvertent arterial dilation, which is particularly important in COVID-19 patients receiving high-dose prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation. Third, when inserting internal jugular and subclavian CVCs, visualization of normal lung sliding before and after the procedure safely rules out pneumothorax. However, if lung sliding is not seen before the procedure, it cannot be used to rule out pneumothorax afterward. Additionally, visualizing absence of the catheter tip in the right atrium and presence of a rapid atrial swirl sign within 2 seconds of briskly injecting 10 mL of saline confirms catheter tip placement near the superior vena cava/right atrial junction, which can eliminate the need for a postprocedure chest radiograph.
17

ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION

POCUS can be used to rapidly confirm endotracheal tube (ETT) placement, which can reduce reliance on postintubation chest radiographs. A meta-analysis of prospective and randomized trials showed transtracheal ultrasonography had high sensitivity (98.7%) and specificity (97.1%) for confirming tracheal placement of ETTs.
19
Confirming endotracheal intubation involves two steps: First, a linear transducer is placed transversely over the suprasternal notch to visualize the ETT passing through the trachea, and not the esophagus, during insertion. Second, after the ETT cuff has been inflated, bilateral lung sliding should be seen in sync with the respiratory cycle if the ETT is in the trachea. Absent lung sliding, but preserved lung pulse, on the anterior hemithorax is likely caused by main stem bronchial intubation, and withdrawing the ETT until bilateral lung sliding is seen confirms tracheal placement. Additionally, the following steps are recommended to reduce the risk of exposure to healthcare workers: minimizing use of bag-valve-mask ventilation, performing rapid sequence intubation using video laryngoscopy, and connecting the ETT to the ventilator immediately.

ULTRASOUND DEVICES AND DISINFECTION

Important considerations when selecting an ultrasound machine for use in COVID-19 patients include image quality, portability, functionality, and ease of disinfection. Advantages of handheld devices include portability and ease of disinfection, whereas cart-based systems generally have better image quality and functionality. To minimize the risk of cross contamination, an ultrasound machine should be dedicated exclusively for use on patients with confirmed COVID-19 and not shared with patients with suspected COVID-19.
20
To minimize exposure to COVID-19 patients, frontline providers should perform POCUS exams only when findings may change management, and timing of the exam and views acquired should be selected deliberately.

Ultrasound machine disinfection should be integrated into routine donning and doffing procedures. When possible, both handheld and cart-based machines should be draped with protective covers during aerosol-generating procedures. Single use ultrasound gel packets are recommended in order to decrease the risk of nosocomial infection.
20
After every use of an ultrasound machine on intact skin or for percutaneous procedures, low-level disinfection should be performed with an Environmental Protection Agency-recommended product that is effective against coronavirus.

Some ultrasound manufacturers have added teleultrasound software that allows remote training of novice POCUS users and remote guidance in actual patient care. Teleultrasound can be utilized to share images in real time with consultants or expert providers.

CONCLUSION

POCUS is uniquely poised to improve patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. POCUS can be used to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients and monitor patients with confirmed disease. Common POCUS applications used in COVID-19 patients include evaluation of the lungs, heart, and deep veins, as well as performance of bedside procedures. Ultrasound machine portability and disinfection are important considerations in COVID-19 patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and has been widely reported; however, a comprehensive systemic review and meta-analysis has not been conducted. We systematically investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in mainland China to guide diagnosis and treatment. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN databases for studies related to COVID-19 published or preprinted in English or Chinese from January 1 to March 15, 2020. Clinical studies on COVID-19 performed in mainland China were included. We collected primary outcomes including signs and symptoms, chest CT imaging, laboratory tests, and treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis was conducted, and random-effects models were applied to pooled estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42020171606). Of the 3624 records identified, 147 studies (20,662 patients) were analyzed. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 49.40 years, 53.45% were male, and 38.52% had at least one comorbidity. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue, expectoration, and shortness of breath. Most patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT findings with ground glass opacity (70.70%) or consolidation (29.91%). Laboratory findings shown lymphopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased infection-related indicators, and fibrinolytic hyperactivity. Antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, and corticosteroids were administered to 89.75%, 79.13%, and 35.64% of patients, respectively. Most clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are non-specific. Patients with suspected should be evaluated by virological assays and clinically treated.

In the Review and Commentary Perspectives of April 2020 issue of
Radiology
(1), and of February 27, published online (2), Dr. Kanne and colleagues reports information relevant for radiologist concerning chest CT parenchymal findings in COVID-19 patients.

Since February 4 2020 online publication of Dr Kanne's article a plethora of studies assessed the incidence of typical and atypical parenchymal findings by unenhanced chest CT. In addition to pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, pulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported with an incidence of 23-30% (3,4).

Dr Kanne stated that ""Overall, the imaging findings reported for 2019-nCoV are similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, not surprising as the responsible viruses are also coronaviruses"" (1) and ""Furthermore, detailed pathologic analysis of patients infected with or who died from COVID-19 infection remains unreported"" (2).

Some fundamentals is needed to consider. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated to high morbidity and mortality; it shares some parenchymal CT findings with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and causes not only pneumonia but also damage to other organs (heart, liver, kidneys) and organ systems (blood and immune system) determining a ""multiple organ injury""; attention should be paid to organ function in the critically ill patients and necessary protective measures or their individual treatment and management (5).

COVID-19 causes direct damage to the endothelial cells of the microvessels which get released into the bloodstream (6); this, coupled with a state of hypercoagulability and a high risk of developing diffuse blood clots or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

DIC is known to be associated with platelet as well as fibrinogen consumption, causing an increased risk of bleeding as well. Based on this mechanism of vascular damage, in our experience in critical ill COVID-19 patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure and alterated D-dimer values, chest-abdomen contrast-enhanced CT is mandatory to detect not only of pneumonia and PE, but also extrapulmonary injuries such as acute pancreatitis, spleen and bilateral kidneys ischemia, retroperitoneal, peritoneal and soft tissues hemorrhage.

Radiologist must be aware of multiple organ injuries that can occur in critical ill COVID-19 patients for a correct use of CT and for an accurate decision-making."

Objective: In the setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a potential association of this disease with stroke has been suggested. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
Methods: This is a case series of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to an academic health system in metropolitan Atlanta (USA) between March 24th,2020, and May 5th, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described.
Results: Of 124 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 8 (6.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 64.3 +/- 6.5 years, 5 (62.5%) male, mean time from last-normal was 4.8 days [SD 4.8], and none received acute reperfusion therapy. All 8 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic; 3 were explained by atrial fibrillation while 5 (62.5%) were cryptogenic. In contrast, cryptogenic strokes were seen in 20 (16.1%) of 124 total stroke admissions during this time.
Conclusions:
In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors with an age of stroke presentation typically seen in non-COVID populations. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes and with a prolonged median time to presentation/symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for aggressive identification and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients.

SUMMARY:
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early reports suggest that there are neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, including acute cerebrovascular disease. We report a case of COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of COVID-19-related cerebral infarcts that includes brain imaging at multiple time points and CT angiography. There is a growing body of published evidence that complications of COVID-19 are not limited to the pulmonary system. Neuroradiologists should be aware of a wide range of neurologic manifestations, including cerebrovascular disease.

We report a case of acute COVID-19 with acute cerebral infarcts, demonstrated by NCCT and extracranial/intracranial CTA. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of COVID-19-related cerebral infarcts to include brain imaging at multiple time points and CT angiographic imaging.

Case Report

A 64-year-old man presented to the emergency department of Allegheny General Hospital with a wake-up stroke with symptoms of left-sided hemiparesis and shortness of breath. The patient's last known well time was >4.5 hours from onset, and intravenous thrombolysis was not recommended. Sixteen days before admission, the patient had been evaluated for fever and myalgias and diagnosed with COVID-19 after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed during the hospital admission via nasopharyngeal swab and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. The patient's relevant medical history included hypertension, aplastic anemia, and splenectomy.

In the emergency department, the patient was tachycardic and hypertensive; demonstrated rapid progressive acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; and required intubation with mechanical ventilation. A chest CT revealed extensive, bilateral ground-glass opacities, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. Due to respiratory and hemodynamic instability, immediate brain and CT angiographic imaging in the emergency department could not be performed safely.

Approximately 5 hours after hospital admission, NCCT revealed large areas of mild hypoattenuation and loss of gray-white differentiation in the territories of the right MCA and bilateral anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) (
Fig 1
). Extracranial/intracranial CTA revealed a 20-mm segmental high-grade stenosis of the proximal ICA at the level of the ICA bifurcation (
Fig 2
). Given that the patient had evidence of mild, diffuse extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease, the high-grade stenosis of the right ICA was favored to represent atherosclerotic disease; however, acute thrombus could have had a similar appearance. The intracranial CTA revealed no large-vessel occlusion, but there was markedly diminished flow in the distal branches of the right MCA and the bilateral ACAs (
Fig 2
). Approximately 24 hours later, a repeat NCCT revealed worsening cerebral edema and mass effect of the infarcts of the right MCA and bilateral ACA territories, consistent with the expected evolution of acute ischemia (
Fig 1
).

A
, NCCT on the day of admission demonstrates subtle findings of acute ischemia in the right MCA (

B
, Repeat NCCT on hospital day 2 demonstrates progression of acute infarcts in the right MCA and bilateral ACA territories, including worsening edema and mass effect.

A
, Sagittal MIP image from the extracranial CTA performed on the day of admission demonstrates a segmental high-grade stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery (

). There is normal flow in the right common carotid and external carotid arteries.
B
, Axial MIP of the intracranial CTA performed on the day of admission demonstrates markedly decreased vascular flow within the branches of the right MCA (

). Conversely, there is normal vascular flow in the left MCA and bilateral posterior cerebral artery territories.

DISCUSSION

A recent case series of 214 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China, reported that 36% of patients demonstrated neurologic manifestations, and acute cerebrovascular disease was reported in 6% of severely affected patients.
5
The precise mechanism for the cerebral ischemia in the clinical setting of COVID-19 is not known, but there is strong evidence for the development of a transient hypercoagulable state, especially in severe disease.
7

In a study of 191 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, researchers found that D-dimer levels of >1 ug/L were associated with an 18-fold increase in odds of death before discharge.
2
D-dimer is a product of fibrin clot degradation and is indicative of recent or current clot formation.

In Zhou et al,
2
patients with COVID-19 with an elevated serum ferritin level of >300 ug/L had a 9-fold increase in the odds of death before discharge. Hyperferritinemia, although nonspecific, can be a marker of an inflammatory response.
8
Hyperferritinemia can also be seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome and its variant, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, both of which are associated with arterial and venous thromboses.
9
This patient with hyperferritinemia also had elevated anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M antibodies, and antiphospholipid syndrome has been recently implicated in the coagulopathy associated with cerebral ischemia in patients with COVID-19.
10

Endothelial damage may also play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in severe COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via binding of the spike protein of the virus to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.
11
ACE2 receptors are found not only in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs but also in the vascular endothelium.
12
Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 may be at risk of thrombogenesis and cerebral ischemia due to both biochemical hypercoagulable states and direct vascular endothelial injury. In our patient, this risk is a distinct possibility because there were large territorial infarcts despite the absence of an intracranial large-vessel occlusion.

In addition, myocardial injury has been reported in 22% of patients with COVID-19 requiring an intensive care unit, and cardiac embolization may also have a contributory role in COVID-19-related cerebral ischemia.
13

Finally, this patient had evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Systemic infection, such as that demonstrated in this patient, is associated with activation of immune and inflammatory pathways leading to plaque disruption, serving as a source of thrombosis.
14

This patient died on hospital day 3 due to COVID-19, and clinical and laboratory evaluations were incomplete; therefore, a more precise pathogenic mechanism of the cerebral infarcts in this patient is indeterminate. It is also not known why only a small percentage of severely affected patients with COVID-19 have cerebral ischemia, whereas most do not.

In conclusion, we report a case of COVID-19 with acute cerebrovascular disease. We believe this is the first published case to include angiographic imaging. Manifestations of COVID-19 are not limited to the respiratory system, and neuroradiologists should be aware of the associated cerebrovascular disease and its potential underlying etiologies.

Objective

Identify clinical and radiographic features of venous infarct as a presenting feature of COVID-19 in the young.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress.

Case description

: Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics.

Conclusion

Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state."

1
Compared to the general population, patients with hemoglobin disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD) or thalassemia are expected to be more severely affected by COVID-19 due to their preexisting chronic morbidities.
2
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not report any specific indications for patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, it can be hypothesized that the rapid spread of the virus may render these patients fragile when fighting the infection.

SCD, a hematological condition with functional asplenia, puts patients at a greater risk to develop acute pulmonary complications, including viral infections.
2
A study by Hussain et al reported four SCD cases that tested positive for COVID-19.
3
These cases initially presented to the emergency department for a typical vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), and the clinical course of their SARS-CoV-2 infection was rather mild. Patients had a history of respiratory complications, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), asthma, or pulmonary embolism, which may be potential risk factors for progressive COVID-19 pulmonary disease in patients with SCD.
3
A series of isolated cases of ACS in SCD patients positive for COVID-19 has been recently reported.
4
,
5
Therefore, very little clinical experience of infected patients with SCD currently exists. For this reason, we believe that certain recommendations must be followed by healthcare professionals treating any SCD patient infected with SARS-CoV-2.

First, it is important to recognize the clinical manifestations suggestive of rapidly progressive ACS, including multi-organ failure, hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Healthcare professionals should differentiate between pneumonia or ACS, and the more diffuse ground glass appearance that is commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Caution should be taken towards increased pulmonary pressures and right heart failure as symptoms suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, which can increase the risk of complications of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pulmonary and cardiac specialists should be consulted in case of suspicion of pulmonary hypertension. It is also important to recognize the high risk of life-threatening sepsis among SCD patients, whose functional hyposplenism renders them vulnerable to superimposed bacterial infections.

In terms of the therapeutic options for these patients, we recommend early aggressive simple or exchange blood transfusions for SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and manifesting fever and cough, have worsening anemia, evidence of hypoxia and/or lung imaging changes. Exchange transfusions should be initiated in case of progressively worsening hypoxemia and clinical deterioration. Blood products shortage is anticipated during the pandemic, so pre-established transfusion thresholds should be adjusted to include mainly patients with severe anemia or with complications, namely ACS or stroke. There currently exists no evidence that being on hydroxyurea would increase SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. However, it is advisable to avoid the routine use or increasing doses of hydroxyurea to reduce the need for repeated phlebotomy and hospital visits.
2
,
6
In areas where severe blood shortages are expected due to the pandemic, a low dose of hydroxyurea is recommended in all pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia, who receive regular blood transfusion therapy for primary or secondary stroke prevention.
7
In the absence of regular blood transfusion therapy, hydroxyurea treatment will also decrease the incidence rates of acute vaso-occlusive pain and ACS events.
7
Noteworthy, a treatment with one single dose of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) was successfully used to treat an adult SCD patient with pneumonia; it was related to COVID-19 infection associated with ACS.
8

Respiratory measures for these patients should not include aerosol-based interventions, but rather nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers, if the room is non-negative pressure. A negative pressure room for non-invasive ventilation, high flow oxygen, and bronchoscopy should also be used.
9
Patients with SCD are often prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. There is emerging data regarding the possible negative effects of these classes of drugs on SCD patients being treated for COVID-19.
9
As data is emerging on a day-by-day basis, clinicians should search for the latest evidence in that regard when encountering patients on these medications.

There is emerging evidence from case series and retrospective studies that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can be complicated by an increased risk of coagulopathy. In addition, SCD patients often experience an increased frequency of viscosity-related events, and have an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. This suggests that they may even be at higher risk compared to COVID-19 patients who do not have SCD. Although data suggests that pediatric COVID-19 patients have a milder clinical course compared to adults, thrombosis has been reported. All adult or pediatric SCD patients with severe COVID-19 should therefore be given prophylactic doses of anticoagulant, unless there is an indication for full anticoagulation.
10
Recent data suggests a reduced 28-day mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Moreover, therapeutic anticoagulation strategies in these patients should also be taken into consideration. The active application of anticoagulants, such as heparin, has been recommended but still needs validation by evidence. There is a close association between elevated D-dimer levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines with disease severity in patients with COVID-19.
11
Blood tests on admission should include platelet count, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels. It is also recommended to check D-dimer levels every 24-48 hours during hospitalization. Stem cell transplants and gene therapy approaches should be deferred for these patients until the pandemic resolves. If the patient is on one of the recently approved drugs for SCD such voxelotor or crizanlizumab, it is advised that they continue therapy. If not yet started, delaying the new drug initiation should be considered.
10

While thalassemia patients do not have the same risk for pulmonary infections as patients with SCD, they also have underlying comorbidities (stemming from ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia and primary or secondary iron overload) that may also make them vulnerable to complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2
A study by Motta et al provided preliminary data from an Italian experience, showing that patients with thalassemia have mild clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
12
They included 10 cases of transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and one case of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), all of whom had thalassemia-related comorbidities and were diagnosed with COVID-19. Six patients required hospitalization and none died. Except for one patient with myelosuppression, there was no increase in blood requirements.
12
A larger sample is required to better understand the impact of COVID-19 in thalassemia patients, but these data suggest that it may not be more severe than the general population. While there is very little clinical experience of infected patients with thalassemia, we believe that certain recommendations must be followed by healthcare professionals treating any thalassemia patient with COVID-19.

Clinicians dealing with COVID-19 thalassemia patients should take into consideration the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability. The need for low dose glucocorticoid supplementation should be considered, while keeping in mind that corticosteroids slow down clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and increase the complication rate. Both, intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, can occur in thalassemia patients. Clinicians should therefore closely monitor blood counts of thalassemia patients with COVID-19, and caution should be maintained towards the possibility of exacerbated hemolytic anemia in the setting of acute viral infection. As for those patients with cardiac disease, routine monitoring for iron overload and related cardiomyopathy should be continued. Although thalassemia is known to be associated with a hypercoagulable state, there is currently no data on increased risk of thromboembolic events among thalassemia patients with COVID-19. However, since there is emerging evidence that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has an increased risk of coagulopathy, we recommend giving prophylactic anticoagulation to all patients with severe COVID-19.

Patients with thalassemia, particularly those in the older age group, are most likely to have been splenectomized. If these patients are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the risk of developing a superimposed secondary bacterial infection, and triggering a life-threatening sepsis should be considered. Therefore, thorough evaluation of any splenectomized thalassemia patient presenting with fever should be made and antibiotics should be initiated for possible bacterial infection. As for blood transfusions, the patient's chronic transfusion regimen must be maintained, as there is no evidence to date that COVID-19 may be transmitted through blood. If thalassemia patients are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but are asymptomatic, iron chelation therapy should not be stopped. However, should the patient become symptomatic, it is advisable to interrupt iron chelation therapy.
6
,
13
Unless conditioning has already been initiated, stem-cell transplants and gene therapy should be deferred for these patients until the pandemic resolves.
13
Should a patient be on the novel erythropoiesis maturation agent luspatercept, therapy should be maintained even if the patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, as there is no evidence that it should be discontinued in this case scenario. If not yet started, delaying the new drug initiation should be considered.
13

The consequences of COVID-19 in patients with SCD and thalassemia are not yet well delineated. Comprehensive and detailed reporting by international medical experts, policy makers, governments, and non-governmental organizations of the clinical course and outcomes in this patient population is needed. This will enhance the understanding of the infection in this patient group and will lead to more evidence-based management recommendations for these patients. Until more data arise, the recommendations we provide herein can be used based on clinicians' best judgment.

Since its recognition in December 2019, covid-19 has rapidly spread globally causing a pandemic. Pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are associated with a greater severity and higher fatality rate of covid-19. Furthermore, covid-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. The cardiovascular interactions of covid-19 have similarities to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and influenza. Specific cardiovascular considerations are also necessary in supportive treatment with anticoagulation, the continued use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, arrhythmia monitoring, immunosuppression or modulation, and mechanical circulatory support.

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the pandemic of the century, with approximately 3.5 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020. Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory

and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications.

COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased utilization of healthcare services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection.

Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others.

Abstract

Background and aim

A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused pneumonia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and spread all over the world. Patients with COVID-19 showed huge differences in the hospital stay, progression, and prognosis. As reported, the comorbidities may play an important role in COVID-19. Here, we aim to address the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.

Conclusions

Our data indicated that CVD is a strong risk factor for rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive medical care should be applied to patients with CVD to prevent rapid deterioration of the disease."

Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and pre-existing cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become hosts or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and pre-print reports pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems.

First appearing in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (
1
,
2
). Given the rapid spread of this virus with consequences on an international scale, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 (
2
). It is imperative that health care workers and researchers across all disciplines be aware of the potential impact that this disease can have on their respective fields and the medical community at large (
3
).

Based on currently observed disease patterns, cardiovascular (CV) specialists will be actively engaged in the care of patients with COVID-19. The infection may directly affect cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pre-existing CVD may predispose to COVID-19 infection. Those with CVD who are infected by the virus have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes, and infection itself is associated with CV complications (
4-6
). Moreover, COVID-19 infection may also have numerous indirect effects relevant to CV health. The large numbers of infected people requiring care may affect optimal treatment delivery to patients with acute CV conditions. Therapeutics for COVID-19 have the potential for adverse CV effects and clinicians delivering CV care are at risk of developing the illness or becoming vectors for the infection. The objective of this review is to characterize the CV impact of COVID-19, its potential consequences in patients with established CVD, as well as considerations for individual patients (with and without COVID-19), health care workers, and health systems, as understanding and addressing these issues will be crucial to optimize outcomes during the current critical period and beyond.

Methodologic Considerations

Given the time-sensitive nature of the challenges associated with this outbreak, we reviewed the published reports (including multiple search strategies in MEDLINE with PubMed interface) and critically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print server (date of last search: March 16, 2020). Because the initial epicenter for this outbreak was from China, the majority of data on patients with COVID-19 are from this region. Although a systematic attempt was made to include reports and viewpoints from other heavily affected countries, data related to CV risk factors or presentation were limited. This is important, because the testing strategies, care-seeking behavior, and hospitalization thresholds vary in different settings and can bias numerators and denominators, influencing estimates of the impact of the virus. This selection bias in testing, care, and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates of pre-existing risk factors and patient presentation across the reports from various countries. Furthermore, the majority of the existing analyses, including those related to CV complications of COVID-19 are based on retrospective and often single-center series. Accordingly, data elements were usually reported via chart review, without external prospective ascertainment. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials were present in this publications search. These issues have important implications for research priority setting, and for interpretations of the results reported herein. There is an urgent need for high-quality research in this area, but at this point it is useful to review the available data.

Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Features of COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2, like other members of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped virus with nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome (
1
,
7
). A number of SARS-related coronaviruses have been discovered in bats, and a working theory is that bats may have been the initial zoonotic host for SARS-CoV-2 given that its genome is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus (

). Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses can use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein that serves many important physiologic functions. It is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, providing the main entry site for the virus into human hosts (
8
,
9
). After ligand binding, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis in a manner akin to human immunodeficiency virus (
10
). ACE2 also serves a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung protective pathway, contributing to viral pathogenicity (
11
).
Figure 1
depicts the potential mechanisms for ACE2 with regard to viral pathogenicity and lung protection, as well as the potential effects on this from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition as noted in the section on Drug Therapy and COVID-19.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via spike protein, which facilitates entry into the cell. It is hypothesized that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition may up-regulate ACE2 expression, thereby increasing viral entry and replication

. ACE2 reduces levels of angiotensin II, which is a potent proinflammatory agent in the lungs and can contribute to lung injury. RAAS inhibitors may block the production or function of angiotensin II and potentially also increase levels of ACE2, thereby indirectly inhibiting angiotensin II

Since initial identification, the disease has spread to over 100 countries across the world (
1
). As of March 16, 2020, at 11:53
am
, there have been a total of 174,961 COVID-19 cases reported globally (3,813 in the United States) associated with 6,705 deaths thus far (69 in the United States), resulting in a crude case-fatality rate of 3.8% (
12
,
13
). Johns Hopkins University is making current data available (
12
,
14
). The infectivity of COVID-19 is greater than that of influenza, with an estimated
R
0
value (the basic reproduction number, representing viral infectivity) of 2.28 (
15
). Notably, the death rate associated with COVID-19 is also considerably higher compared with the most recent World Health Organization estimate of seasonal influenza mortality rate of <0.1%, and may reach much higher rates in elderly patients, those with comorbidities, and in those for whom efficient intensive care support is absent (
13
). While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002 to 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (
16
), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (
16
,
17
). Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (
16
); 2) there are inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness; and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection). Notably, the appraisal of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be further complicated by asymptomatic infection in a sizable portion of individuals, which may significantly contribute to further spread of infection (
18
).

The clinical presentation for COVID-19 is quite variable. A large study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated that among 72,314 patients with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory confirmed, 16,186 suspected, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed), the clinical severity was reported as mild in 81.4%, severe in 13.9%, and critical in 4.7% (
16
). The clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 appear to include symptoms common to other viral infections (i.e., fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, fatigue, and diarrhea) as well as laboratory abnormalities such as lymphopenia (
19
), although knowledge of the clinical feature of the disease is evolving daily (
1
,
20
). In severe cases, COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with or without both distributive and cardiogenic shock, to which elderly populations with pre-existing medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable (
1
,
6
,
20
,
21
). Notably whereas rates of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacterial superinfections in preliminary data appear low (
16
), patients with the most severe clinical presentations are likely still at risk for coinfections, and unsurprisingly, worse outcomes have been noted in such cases (
21
,
22
). Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (
23
). However, moderate-to-severe illness has been described in children as well (
24
). Moreover, it is not clear how often children were being tested.

Because an extremely large and increasing number of patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19, identification of prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality are crucial. To date, no approved preventative vaccines or approved therapies are available for COVID-19, although several are being actively studied (
25
).

Prevalence of CVD in Patients With COVID-19

The lack of widespread testing, national surveillance, and standardized data collection, as well as the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized patients with more comorbidities such as CVD has complicated efforts to accurately estimate the prevalence of CVD in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, there is marked variation in testing by country. A number of studies in the available reports suggest an association between pre-existing CVD and severe COVID-19, which are summarized in
Tables 1
and
2
. A meta-analysis of 6 studies inclusive of 1,527 patients with COVID-19 examined the prevalence of CVD and reported the prevalence of hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes to be 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively (
4
). Patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission were more likely to have these comorbidities than were non-ICU patients. Increased case-fatality rates in the previously referenced analysis of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China, were noted in patients with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6.0%), all notably higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% (
16
). Several smaller cohort studies have yielded similar results, suggesting higher risk for adverse events in patients with CVD who contract COVID-19, although biases related to testing and standardized data apply here as well (
1
,
20
,
26-29
). Notably, whereas reports outside of China are limited, data from Italy suggest similar mortality rates and an elevated risk for death in patients with comorbidities (
30
). As emerging international data become available, analysis from multinational cohorts can help inform risk stratification for severe disease especially for patients with prior CVD.

Association Among Underlying CV Risk Factors, Known CVD, and Outcomes in COVID-19

COVID-19 outcomes and CVD: Potential mechanisms of increased risk

Mechanisms that lead to CVD are increasingly recognized to overlap with pathways that regulate immune function. For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 years who receive the influenza vaccine (
31
,
32
). Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia affect immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (
33-36
). Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post-COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings that are complex, multifactorial, and bidirectional (
37
,
38
). In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen that contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment (
Figure 1
) (
5
). Additional study is needed to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes.

Heart transplantation

In addition to the mechanisms by which COVID-19 can affect patients with CVD risk factors, it is also important to consider COVID-19 in the context of an especially vulnerable group of patients, such as individuals awaiting or who have undergone heart transplantation. There are now case reports of COVID-19 infection among heart transplant patients (
39
,
40
). Two heart transplant patients in China, 1 with mild and 1 with severe disease, presented with symptoms typical of COVID-19 disease. Both were managed by withholding baseline immunosuppressive regimens and treating aggressively with high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, and both survived without evidence of allograft rejection. Previous viral outbreaks have noted particularly severe infection in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients (
41
). Formal treatment guidelines in these patients do not exist at this time. Heart allocation teams need to consider the optimal screening strategies to prevent severe infection in recipients including whether all donor hearts should be screened, given the existence of asymptomatic COVID-19, versus limiting screening to patients with a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19. During the influenza A subtype H1N1 pandemic, to prevent infection in the recipient or as an impetus to initiate prophylaxis if the donor was positive, potential donors were screened if they were symptomatic or had significant exposure history (
42
). Similarly, screening recipients for a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19 to avoid a post-transplant flare will be reasonable to be considered. Utmost precautions in infection control must be employed when interacting with these vulnerable immunosuppressed patients.

Cardiovascular Sequelae Associated With COVID-19

Figure 2
summarizes some of the potential CV sequelae that may result from COVID-19 infection. Pending larger studies, several existing reports are suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to CV complications or exacerbation of pre-existing CVD (
6
,
16
,
22
).

Risk Factors for Complications and Cardiovascular Sequelae of COVID-19

Risk factors for complications in patients afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and potential cardiovascular issues that may result from this disease process. CVD = cardiovascular disease.

Myocardial injury, myocarditis, and acute coronary syndromes

Myocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, can occur due to myocardial ischemia or nonischemic myocardial processes including myocarditis (
6
,
43
,
44
). With severe respiratory infection and hypoxia, especially in the setting of severe infection and ARDS due to COVID-19, it is likely that a number of patients will develop such injury. Elevated serum troponin levels have been described in many patients infected with COVID-19, with significant differences noted between patients who died and those who survived to discharge (
22
,
45
). In a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 341 patients, standardized mean difference of cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19-related illness compared with in those with nonsevere disease (25.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8 to 44.5) (
46
). Reports have also suggested that acute cardiac injury--which includes not only elevation of cardiac biomarkers to >99th percentile of the upper reference limit, but also electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities--is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis. Cohort studies from hospitalized patients in China estimate that such injury occurs in 7% to 17% of hospitalized patients with the disease (
1
,
6
,
20
) and is significantly more common in patients admitted to the ICU (22.2% vs. 2.0%; p < 0.001) and among those who died (59% vs. 1%; p < 0.0001) (
6
,
8
). However, troponin levels can be exacerbated in patients with renal insufficiency due to delayed excretion, which is common in patients with advanced disease. Given limited high-quality data, and the heterogeneity of definitions across the studies, standardized data collection methods are recommended using the most recent Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) (
44
).

Prior studies in other coronavirus species (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated evidence of acute myocarditis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (
47
), and myocardial inflammation and damage have been reported with COVID-19 infection. Among 68 deaths in a case series of 150 patients with COVID-19, 7% were attributed to myocarditis with circulatory failure and 33% to cases in which myocarditis may have played a contributing role to the patient's demise (
22
). Other reports have described fulminant myocarditis in the setting of high viral load with autopsy findings of inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate in myocardial tissue (
27
,
48
,
49
). While glucocorticoid therapy and other agents have been administered (
50
), the most effective treatment strategy for such patients is yet to be defined. Pericardial involvement has not yet been reported, but further study is needed. Pericardial involvement has not yet been reported but further study is needed. In addition, the extent to which supply and demand mismatch (type 2 MI) in patients with underlying CVD have contributed to the CV manifestations of the syndrome is uncertain.

Case reports of acute coronary syndromes (type 1 MI) in the setting of COVID-19 have yet to be published. Nonetheless, the profound inflammatory response and hemodynamic changes associated with severe disease may confer risk for atherosclerotic plaque rupture in susceptible patients (
6
). In this regard, analysis by Kwong et al. (
37
) demonstrated that patients with acute respiratory infections are at elevated risk for subsequently developing acute MI after influenza (incidence ratio: 6.1; 95% CI: 3.9 to 9.5) and after noninfluenza viral illnesses including other coronavirus species (incidence ratio: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2 to 6.2). The development of care pathways and protocols for COVID-19 patients with ST-segment elevation MI suggest that both within and outside of China such a clinical scenario is highly probable (
51
).

Additionally, it is important to note potential overlapping symptomatology between acute coronary syndromes and COVID-19. Even though the predominant presenting symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory, a case report described a patient in Italy with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes for which the cardiac catheterization lab was activated. Notably, the patient was found to be free of obstructive coronary artery disease but ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 (
52
). Moving forward as the virus continues to infect patients with significant CV risk factors or established CVD, cases of acute coronary syndromes in the setting of COVID-19 are likely to develop. The true prevalence in this setting may be under-reported given the logistical challenges associated with limited testing and cardiac catheterization laboratory availability in the setting of this outbreak. For further recommendations for the care and management of COVID-19 patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, please see the joint American College of Cardiology and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention guidance statement (
53
).

Cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest

Cardiac arrhythmias are another common CV manifestation described in patients with COVID-19 infection. Though nonspecific, heart palpitations were part of the presenting symptomology in 7.3% of patients in a cohort of 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease (
27
). In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cardiac arrhythmia was noted in 16.7% of 138 patients in a Chinese cohort and was more common in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (44.4% vs. 6.9%) (
20
). Unfortunately, specifics about the types of arrhythmias that occur in these patients are yet to be published or presented. High prevalence of arrhythmia might be, in part, attributable to metabolic disarray, hypoxia, or neurohormonal or inflammatory stress in the setting of viral infection in patients with or without prior CVD. However, new onset of malignant tachyarrhythmias in the setting of troponin elevation should raise suspicion for underlying myocarditis (
45
,
54
).

Cardiomyopathy and heart failure

Zhou et al. (
6
) reported that heart failure was observed in 23.0% of patients with COVID-19 presentations. Notably, heart failure was more commonly observed than acute kidney injury in this cohort and was more common in patients who did not survive the hospitalization than in those who did survive (51.9% vs. 11.7%). Whether heart failure is most commonly due to exacerbation of pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction versus new cardiomyopathy (either due to myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy) remains unclear (
55
). Right heart failure and associated pulmonary hypertension should be also considered, in particular in the context of severe parenchymal lung disease and ARDS.

Cardiogenic and mixed shock

The predominant clinical presentation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory illness, which may lead to ARDS manifested as ground-glass opacities on chest imaging (
56
) and hypoxemia. However, similar features may be seen in the case of de novo or coexisting cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As such, it is important to consider cardiogenic or mixed cardiac plus primary pulmonary causes of respiratory manifestations in COVID-19. Historically, right heart catheterization was used to determine pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to aid in this distinction, although this has been removed from the Berlin criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS. Rather, the Berlin criteria use timing of symptom onset, imaging with bilateral pulmonary opacities, and lack of volume overload to identify patients with ARDS (
57
). In many cases, serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography can help clarify the diagnosis (
58
,
59
). However, if these tests are unclear and there remains concern for mixed presentation, pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered in select cases to assess filling pressures, cardiac output, and to guide clinical decision making, given the different management approaches for ARDS and cardiogenic shock. Finally, it is crucial to determine whether a concomitant cardiogenic component is present when considering mechanical respiratory and circulatory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) or other techniques, as this may lead to changes in device selection (e.g., venovenous vs. venoarterial ECMO cannulation). Regardless, in the most severe of infections with ARDS and necrotizing pneumonias, patient prognosis may be poor even with ECMO support. In a case series of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 83.3% (5 of 6) of patients who were treated with ECMO did not survive. Further studies regarding the utility of ECMO support in advanced COVID-19, including which patients may (or may not) benefit and whether concomitant left ventricular venting should be done, are warranted (
60
).

Venous thromboembolic disease

COVID-19 infected patients are likely at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and data from Klok et al. (
61
) suggests that rates of thrombotic complications may be as high as 31% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Reports suggest abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease (
62
,
63
). In a multicenter retrospective cohort study from China, elevated D-dimer levels (>1 g/l) were strongly associated with in-hospital death, even after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio: 18.4; 95% CI: 2.6 to 128.6; p = 0.003) (
6
). In another study comparing COVID-19 survivors to nonsurvivors, nonsurvivors had significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation products levels, and 71.4% of nonsurvivors met clinical criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation during the course of their disease (
62
). In addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation, critically ill patients with prolonged immobilization are inherently at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Vascular inflammation may also contribute to the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients. In the setting of critically ill COVID-19 patients who demonstrate clinical deterioration as evidenced by hypoxia or hemodynamic instability, thromboembolic disease should be considered. Retrospective data from 97 patients with severe COVID-19, the majority of whom received prophylactic dose low-molecular-weight heparin in the setting of sepsis-induced coagulopathy, suggests that anticoagulation in such patients may be associated with lower mortality rates (
64
). The optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness is not known, however. As such, contemporary guideline-endorsed strategies should be observed (
65
). Given the drug-drug interactions between some antiviral treatments and direct oral anticoagulants, low molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical prophylaxis are likely to be preferred in acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Data regarding antiviral therapies and other treatment strategies, as well as their potential interaction with CV medications and CV toxicities are summarized in
Tables 3
,
4
, and
5
. Although currently there are no specific effective therapies for COVID-19, various pharmacologic agents are under active investigation. As these drugs are being studied, it is important to review the potential CV side effects and interactions with other CV medications.

Recommendations Regarding Dosing and Adjustment in the Setting of Medication Interactions

Antiviral therapy

Antivirals are at the forefront of medications under study for the treatment COVID-19 and the clinical trial identifiers for each are listed in
Table 3
. Ribavirin and remdesivir are 2 such agents that bind to the active site on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on SARS-CoV-2 (
66
), whereas lopinavir/ritonavir inhibits replication of RNA virus and has evidence of a synergistic effect in vitro with ribavirin (
67
). Ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir are under investigation in clinical trials for COVID-19 and have been used for years as components of treatment for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, respectively (
68
,
69
). Whereas ribavirin has no characterized direct CV toxicity, lopinavir/ritonavir may result in QT- and PR-interval prolongation, especially in patients who have a baseline abnormality (long QT) or those who are at risk for conduction abnormalities including those taking other QT prolonging drugs (
69
). Both ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir have the potential to affect anticoagulant dosing: ribavirin has variable effects on warfarin dosing (
70
) and lopinavir/ritonavir may require dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A-mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban (
71
,
72
).

Lopinavir/ritonavir can also influence the activity of P2Y
12
inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, which results in decreased serum concentrations of the active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel and increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor. The active metabolite for clopidogrel is mostly formed by CYP2C19, but several other CYP enzymes contribute, including CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A (
73
,
74
). Given the increase in serum ticagrelor levels with such medications (
75
,
76
), concomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged in the United States and Canada due to excess in bleeding risk. Conversely, there is evidence that clopidogrel may not always provide sufficient platelet inhibition in the setting of concomitant administration of ritonavir, whereas this was not the case with prasugrel as assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y
12
assay (Accumetrics, San Diego, California) (
73
,
74
). If P2Y
12
inhibition is needed during treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, prasugrel can be used; however, if contraindicated (i.e., history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, low body mass index, or active pathological bleeding), a testing-guided approach (e.g., with P2Y
12
platelet function assays) may be considered with alternate antiplatelet agents. Details about switching between P2Y
12
inhibitors have been described elsewhere (
77
). Finally, metabolism of the intravenous P2Y
12
inhibitor, cangrelor, is independent of hepatic function, therefore a drug interaction is not expected (
78
).

b-Hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) also have the potential to interact with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and can result in myopathy due to elevated statin levels when administered together. Lovastatin and simvastatin, in particular, are contraindicated for coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir due to risk of rhabdomyolysis. Other statins, including atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, should be administered at the lowest possible dose but not to exceed the maximum dose stated in the package insert while on lopinavir/ritonavir (
69
).

Remdesivir is an investigational drug previously evaluated in the Ebola epidemic and is now being studied in patients with COVID-19. The drug is currently available in clinical trials and through compassionate use from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Foster City, California). Whereas extensive CV toxicities and medication interactions have yet to be reported, prior evaluation of this drug during the Ebola outbreak did note the development of hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest after loading dose in 1 patient (among 175 total) (
79
).

Other treatments

Table 4
presents information on other treatments being studied for COVID-19 (including ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers). In addition to antiviral medications, numerous immune-modulating and secondary medications to prevent complications that could arise from COVID-19 are currently being investigated. Chloroquine, which has been used as an antimalarial agent, blocks virus infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and has been demonstrated in vitro to have inhibitory activity in SARS-CoV-2 (
80
,
81
). Chloroquine and the closely related hydroxychloroquine have the potential for intermediate-to-delayed myocardial toxicity. Risk factors include long-term exposure (>3 months), higher weight-based dose, pre-existing cardiac disease, and renal insufficiency (
82
). Chloroquine cardiac toxicity presents as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or conduction abnormalities thought to be due to intracellular inhibition of lysosomal enzymes in the myocyte (
82
,
83
). In addition, due to effects of chloroquine on CYP2D6 inhibition, beta-blockers metabolized via CYP2D6 (such as metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, or labetalol) can have increased concentration of drug requiring careful monitoring for heart rate and blood pressure shifts. Lastly, both agents are associated with a conditional risk of torsade des pointes in patients with electrolyte abnormalities or with concomitant use of QT-interval-prolonging agents. Short-term exposure to these agents, as would be expected in treatment of COVID-19, confers lower risk of these dose-duration-dependent side effects.

Methylprednisolone is another drug under investigation that is currently being used to treat severe cases of COVID-19 that are complicated by ARDS (
49
). A retrospective analysis in patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS demonstrated that methylprednisolone use was associated with decreased mortality (
28
). This steroid is known to cause fluid retention, electrolyte derangement, and hypertension as direct CV effects, and it also may interact with warfarin via an undescribed mechanism. Clinicians are advised to observe for these drug interactions.

Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, is often used as part of treatment of patients with viral illnesses. However, recent anecdotal evidence has raised wider concerns that the use of ibuprofen can potentially contribute to severe disease in patients with COVID-19 (
84
). While data is limited, one of the working theories is that ibuprofen may interfere with the host's immune response to infection. Therefore, at least preliminarily, this mechanism for worse outcomes in patients taking ibuprofen does not appear to involve the CV system.

Finally, patient debilitation from severe COVID-19 may pose challenges in administering routine CV medications, ranging from antiplatelet therapy to beta-blockers, thus putting patients with or at risk of ischemic heart disease or heart failure at risk of further deterioration of their clinical condition.

ACE2 and potential therapeutic implications

As the ACE2 receptor is the mechanism of entry for SARS-CoV-2, some data suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may up-regulate ACE2, thereby increasing susceptibility to the virus (
Figure 1
) (
5
). In contrast, other studies show that ACE inhibitors/ARBs may potentiate the lung protective function of ACE2, by reducing angiotensin II levels through its conversion to angiotensin (
1-7
,
85-87
). Thus, the therapeutic implications for ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy during COVID-19 infection is unclear. Overall, there are insufficient data to suggest any mechanistic connections involving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy with contracting COVID-19 or with severity illness once infected.

Considerations for Health Care Workers

Protective equipment for CV health care workers

The
Central Illustration
demonstrates key considerations for treating patients in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early reports from the outbreak have suggested that transmission occurs most commonly via respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land on exposed mucous membranes or be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity and the virus may remain active on surfaces for several days (
88
). Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously recommended airborne precautions for the care of patients with COVID-19, this recommendation was recently changed such that only patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures require airborne isolation. Recommendations made by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for personal protective equipment (PPE) are in agreement that standard, contact precautions with face mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves are necessary (
53
). When available, respirators are preferred.

In addition, when performing certain procedures that are aerosol-generating, such as transesophageal echocardiography, endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and bag mask ventilation, additional PPE may be required, including controlled or powered air purifying respirators. Thorough infection prevention and control measures specific to the procedural cardiology specialties must be considered in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such procedures are associated with the small but quantifiable risk of complications and patient deterioration. In the event of a cardiac arrest, efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation causing aerosolized pathogens could result in the wide dissemination of virus particles to clinicians, health care workers, and other patients. One measure that may help protect health care workers in the setting of cardiac arrest and chest compressions is the use of external mechanical compression devices to minimize direct contact with infected patients. Another important consideration for the catheterization laboratory is appropriate post-intervention cleaning of all equipment potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. The necessary downtime required for cleaning may seriously affect the availability of catheterization laboratory-based treatments for other patients. As such, many hospitals are minimizing or cancelling elective procedures during the growth phase of the outbreak. Another consideration is the fact that catheterization laboratories and operating rooms are typically configured with positive pressure ventilation, and there have been reports of centers in China converting such facilities to negative pressure isolation in the setting of COVID-19 (
89
). Guidance and recommendations in this space will be forthcoming from interventional communities, including the American College of Cardiology and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (
53
).

Figure 3
depicts key information summarizing considerations to prevent infection among CV health care workers as summarized in an infographic. Overall, as CV health care workers are on the front lines treating COVID-19-infected patients, all possible measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of exposure (
90
). Health care workers are at elevated risk for contracting this virus, as demonstrated by Wu et al. (
16
), noting 1,716 of the 44,672 infected individuals (3.8%) were health care workers. This fact emphasizes the need for self-protection with PPE before caring for potentially exposed COVID-19 patients and provides further rationale for delaying elective procedures. In teaching hospitals, it is imperative to minimize exposure among trainees and nonessential staff (e.g., medical students) not only for their own safety and that of their patients, but also for conservation of PPE and for avoiding the unnecessary increase in the number of asymptomatic vectors. Finally, transmission between health care workers is also a major concern, especially in the setting of emergency or suboptimal logistics, or when devices for PPE have become scarce.

Triaging CV patients and visits

There are numerous considerations specific to the care of CV patients that should be taken into account to minimize risk for COVID-19 transmission to patients and health care workers; these considerations are outlined in
Table 6
. One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already used by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. Although there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine, such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (
91
). Other essential principles are to minimize nonessential/nonurgent in-person health care worker-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e., social distancing) and limit elective cardiac catheterization, operating room, and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personnel should be kept to a minimum.

Considerations for Health Systems and Management of Noninfected CV Patients

CV societal leadership

Recently, due to potential health concerns for the CV health care workers and investigators, and to avert deterioration of the COVID-19 outbreak, the American College of Cardiology made the unprecedented but appropriate decision to cancel the 2020 Scientific Sessions meeting. Similarly, a number of medical conferences around the world are either being canceled or postponed (
92
). Additionally, given the clear implications of this pandemic on CV care, numerous societies have already weighed in with guidance statements, which are summarized in
Table 7
. The American College of Cardiology Clinical Bulletin provides a practical clinical summary about key implications and recommendations for CV care of COVID-19 patients (
93
). The European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension and European Society of Hypertension statements acknowledge the questions regarding ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in the setting of COVID-19 patients (
94
,
95
). These societies as well as a number of others agree that further data would be vital to inform decisions on adjusting regimens of these agents in the setting of this outbreak (
96-98
). Moving forward, these important CV societies among other large physician groups and health systems will be critical allies to advance the knowledge generation and CV care in patients infected with this virus.

Preparing for hospital surges and prioritizing care for the critically ill

A comprehensive package of measures is required for hospital systems to fully prepare for COVID-19 (
Table 5
). A significant increase in COVID-19 patients should be anticipated. At the same time, provisions for general health services for acute and severe chronic illnesses must be maintained. Specifically, regarding CV care, as the pandemic surges, hospitals may prioritize the treatment of severe and high-risk patients and enact policy to prevent overwhelming of the health care system by the ""worried well."" Given concerns of hospitals exceeding capacity, specific protocols will need to be developed for the care of CV patients while preserving limited in-patient resources and minimizing health care worker and patient exposures. There are reports of individual centers developing alternate ST-segment elevation MI pathways in the setting of the COVID-19 crisis, such as using fibrinolytic therapy if delays to primary percutaneous coronary intervention are anticipated when hospitals are at capacity or staffing for the catheterization lab is inadequate (
51
). A recent report from China also suggests substantial delays in door-to-device time in patients presenting with STEMI during the COVID-19 outbreak (
99
). Additionally, repurposing cardiac ICUs as medical ICUs for the care of patients with COVID-19 will likely become necessary, but this may limit the quality of specialty care for CV patients. Given the need for ICU beds after cardiac surgery, medical management or percutaneous interventional approaches may need to be preferentially considered for urgent scenarios that cannot wait (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention rather than coronary artery bypass graft surgery or transcatheter valve solutions rather than surgery) to minimize ICU bed utilization. Furthermore, as mentioned, appropriate use and careful selection of ECMO-appropriate patients as well as having established ECMO protocols for COVID-19 patients are important strategies to consider (
60
).

Need for education

Information on the most up-to-date evidence surrounding management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 should be widely disseminated and freely available and should be provided in illustrative formats (e.g., infographics) that improve public knowledge and understanding. The free flow of communication between health care workers and hospitals is paramount to effectively combat the pandemic. The care of patients with COVID-19 will require the expertise of many specialty services including pulmonology/critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, surgery, pharmacy, and hospital administration among others. Optimal infection control and treatment strategies for COVID-19 should be shared with the entire health care community. Accordingly, every effort must be made to provide clear and unambiguous information to patients and decision makers, countering myths and false news that may generate panic or false optimism. As the evidence base surrounding COVID-19 and its management is evolving on a daily basis, the dissemination of accurate information must occur in real time.

Ethical challenges

The unprecedented challenge represented by COVID-19 has brought novel and dramatic ethical dilemmas, ranging from policy issues (e.g., focusing on containment and mitigation vs. herd immunity), as well as clinical dilemmas (e.g., considering all patients alike vs. triaging patients according to age, comorbidities, and expected prognosis, similar to other catastrophic circumstances). Close interaction among patient advocates, government officials, and regulators, as well as physician groups, hospital administrators, and other societal leaders will be essential to navigate these ethical challenges.

Conclusions and Future Directions

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of patients and poses a major health threat on an international scale. The CV community will play a key role in the management and treatment of patients affected by this disease in addition to providing continuity of care to noninfected patients with underlying CVD. In the coming months, efforts toward evaluating new therapies will be crucial to the treatment of this virus, and as this process develops, further appreciation of the intricate interplay among COVID-19, CVD, and the various stakeholders involved including patients, health care workers, and health care systems will be crucial to improving outcomes in at-risk and infected patients. Prospective randomized clinical trials and cohort studies are ongoing and will be important to helping treat patients affected by this virus.

A number of theories exist regarding the elevated risk for adverse events for patients with CVD who develop COVID-19. In particular, better understanding of the relationships involving the ACE2 protein, antihypertensive agent use, and COVID-19 prognosis will have important implications for patients with both COVID-19 and CVD. Outside of the scope of individual trials, concerted efforts by all health care workers and incisive leadership are required to help mitigate the health risk to the population at large, as well as to CV health care workers, as demonstrated by the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions. Efficient use of resources, including leveraging of the telehealth capabilities, and optimal adherence to preventative population-wide and health care worker-level measures will enable the transition from this critical period until the disease outbreak is contained.

Abstract

Background

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.

Objective

This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

Discussion

The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death. The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness. The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with COVID-19."

In December 2019, the world started to face a new pandemic situation, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. Cardiac manifestations etiology seems to be multifactorial, comprising direct viral myocardial damage, hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory status, ACE2-receptors downregulation, drug toxicity, endogenous catecholamine adrenergic status, among others. Studies evaluating patients with COVID-19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID-19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity. This review focus on COVID-19 cardiac and arrhythmic manifestations and, in parallel, makes an appraisal of other virus epidemics as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and H1N1 influenza.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the last December, the entire world is facing a new pandemic situation, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After emerging from Wuhan-China, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread throughout the world. Due to all its unknown factors, physicians are passing through real-time learning process. As the disease spreads, a massive wave of information takes over scientific journals and media.

This new virus belongs to the same severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) family. Although COVID-19 clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, with the growing number of infected patients, major cardiac complications have been reported in a considerable number of patients with COVID-19.

3

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators that may play important roles in the pathophysiology of cardiac and arrhythmic complications. In a single center study
1
cardiac injury was observed in 19% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and it was associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, it is plausible that these patients have an even higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

Aiming to shed some light in this issue, we performed this review focused on COVID-19 cardiac manifestations not only by analyzing the preliminary available evidence about the virus, but also by making comparative considerations with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H1N1 influenza.

1.1 Lesson from previous epidemics

Much of our present knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 comes from previous historical epidemics that preceded the current outbreak, as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H1N1 influenza syndromes. It was observed, during these outbreaks, a significant association between underlying cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury, and worse outcomes.
4

The first human infection by a new strain of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, was reported in 2002. At that time it was known that, at least in rabbits, coronavirus infections could induce cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiac chambers dilatation and systolic function impairment, simulating other dilated cardiomyopathies.
5

In humans, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and even sudden cardiac death (SCD) were described as possible SARS-CoV manifestations.
6
In a cohort of 121 patients, Yu et al demonstrated that sinus tachycardia was the commonest cardiovascular SARS-CoV finding with an overall incidence of 72%. Persistent tachycardia mean duration was 12.7 days with a mean heart rate of 117 beats/min (range: 102-150 beats/min) and the tachycardia remained persistent in nearly 40% of patients within 30 days after hospital discharge. The incidence of tachycardia during the third hospitalization week, when most patients were afebrile, could be related to drug treatment, such corticosteroid and ribavirin. However, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with persistent tachycardia during follow-up. Hence, longstanding tachycardia could eventually be due to autonomic tone changing. Or, alternatively, sinus tachycardia secondary to cardiopulmonary or peripheral deconditioning since this disease resulted in prolonged bed rest.
7

Besides these findings, significant sinus bradycardia was seen in 18 (14.9%) patients. Unlike tachycardia, which was persistent, bradycardia was somewhat transient with a mean heart rate of 43 beats/min (range: 38-49 beats/min) and a mean duration of 2.6 days. Reversible cardiomegaly was also reported in 13 (10.7%), with no clinical evidence of heart failure (HF). Transient atrial fibrillation was observed in one patient.
7

In the setting of the 2012 MERS-CoV syndrome, despite some similarities with SARS-CoV, the early mortality rate for the former achieved 60%,
10
remaining higher than 35% during the overall outbreak period, while for SARS-CoV the mortality rate was about 10%.
11
A meta-analysis suggested that MERS-CoV infection was more likely to occur in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases.
12
In terms of overall complications, renal failure (40.9%), cardiac arrhythmias (15.7%), hepatic dysfunction (31.4%),
13
besides pericarditis, and hypotension were the most commonly reported.
14
In a case report published by Alhogbani, he describes an acute myocarditis caused by MERS-CoV; a 60-year-old presenting with respiratory symptoms, chest pain, and persistent tachycardia (120 bpm). Echocardiogram demonstrated severe left ventricular function impairment, cardiac magnetic resonance showed typical findings of acute myocarditis, and sputum was positive for MERS-CoV. The patient was intubated and required hemodialysis. After 6 weeks of intensive care unit (ICU) and 1 month of ward hospitalization, he was discharged in stable condition.
15

Last but not least, influenza virus infection is well-known to aggravate plenty of cardiovascular disorders, being associated with myocarditis, myocardial infarction, and HF exacerbation.
16

An interesting survey conducted by Madjid et al tested the possible effect of seasonal influenza on the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) requiring shock or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) treatment in patients with implantable cardiac defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator. The results indicated that more shocks were delivered during influenza season than during other periods of the year, suggesting a correlation between higher arrhythmia burden and influenza season. The multivariate generalized linear model showed that during high influenza activity, patients were more likely to have a VA treated with shock (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06;
P
< .001) or ATP (OR: 1.06;
P
< .0001).
17

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain influenza triggering arrhythmias, among them severe systemic, arterial, and myocardial inflammatory reaction seems to be one of the most plausible. Moreover, influenza is known to exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) and increase CHF-related hospital admissions.
18
Decompensated CHF, besides leading to hospitalization, is related to electrical myocardial homeostasis impairment, causing ventricular tachycardias (VTs) treated with shock or ATP therapy. In patients with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy, the worsening of ischemia by increased oxygen demand and potential acute coronary syndromes led by influenza can also have a role in the increase of arrhythmic events.
17

These concepts were strengthened by a nationwide Denmark studied, which showed a strong relationship between yearly influenza vaccination and mortality in patients with HF. In this study, annual influenza vaccination was associated with 18% reduction in the adjusted risk of all-cause death and 18% reduction in the adjusted risk of cardiovascular death (
P
< .001, for both). Remarkably, those who received more than one seasonal vaccination also had a more pronounced reduction in atrial fibrillation incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.94;
P
= .009). According to this study, influenza infection may result in increased metabolic demand, hypoxia, and adrenergic surges, which may lead to acute decompensation or exacerbation of HF. Additionally, the infection may induce a hypercoagulable state and trigger acute coronary syndromes, resulting in further left ventricular function deterioration, or it could cause direct myocardial depression. Based on these results, the authors advocated that influenza vaccination may be a valuable treatment strategy to improve survival in patients with HF.

1.2 Coronavirus disease

Despite not being particularly lethal, SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious. In a published clinical cohort of patients with COVID-19, they observed that acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmias were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively, with higher prevalence amongst patients requiring intensive care.
2
In this report, myocardial injury biomarkers levels were significantly higher in patients requiring ICU admission than in those not treated in the ICU (median creatine kinase-MB level 18 U/l vs 14 U/l;
P
< .001; and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI] level 11.0 pg/mL vs 5.1 pg/mL;
P
= .004), suggesting that patients with severe symptoms often have complications involving acute myocardial injury.
2
Overall, arrhythmia rate was also more frequent in ICU patients (44.4% vs 6.9%;
P
< .001). Despite the relevance of these initial data, the authors did not provide any arrhythmia classification or definition Table
1
.

A study from Shi et al evaluated a single-center cohort of 416 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. He observed that cardiac lesion, defined by hs-cTnI >99th percentile of on admission, was present in 19.7%, with median value of 0.19 (0.08-1.12) mg/L in this group. Compared with those without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury required more noninvasive ventilation (46.3% vs 3.9%;
P
< .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0% vs 4.2%;
P
< .001), and also had a higher mortality (51.2% vs 4.5%;
P
< .001). It is remarkable that the elevated troponin group was older and significantly more ill, but after adjustment for all the possible confounding factors, still the cardiac injury was a predictor of mortality (HR: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.92-9.49).
1

In another small report, Huang et al demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 associated myocardial injury occurred on 5 out of 41 patients, and was manifested as an increase in hs-cTnI levels (>28 pg/mL). Among these five patients, ICU management was required in four, indicating the severe nature of the myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19.
20

In a study by Guo et al, 187 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive were analyzed, stratified by the level of troponin, which was elevated in 27.8%. During hospitalization, patients with elevated troponin T (TnT) levels developed more frequently complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (57.7% vs 11.9%), malignant VAs (11.5% vs 5.2%), acute coagulopathy (65.8% vs 20.0%), and acute kidney injury (36.8% vs 4.7%), compared with those with normal TnT levels. But the most impressive observation is that mortality was markedly higher in patients with elevated plasma TnT levels than in patients with normal TnT levels (59.6% vs 8.9%).
21

Contrary to the above mentioned studies Zhou et al comparing survivors and non-survivors in a cohort of 191 patients from two hospitals in Wuhan, found that, despite more frequent in non-survivors (46% vs 1%;
P
< .001), hs-cTnI >28 pg/mL was not associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. Even though, it is remarkable that this study was unpowered to draw conclusions from this analysis due to the excess of variable for only 54 events.
22

Acute myocarditis, as well as VAs might represent the first clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
3
,
44
In the epicenter of the current Italian epidemic, SCD likely occurred in many nonhospitalized patients with mild symptoms who were found dead home while in quarantine. Myocardial biomarkers should be evaluated in all patients with COVID-19 for risk stratification and prompt intervention. Even after hospital discharge, we should consider that myocardial injury might result in atrial or ventricular fibrosis, the substrate for subsequent cardiac arrhythmias. The extent of myocardial scar, as assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance, might be a powerful tool to better stratify the arrhythmic risk in patients recovered from COVID-19 who had evidence of myocardial injury at the time of infection.

Another relevant aspect of COVID-19 infection is that early diagnosis can be confounded in patients with chronic cardiac conditions, once the most frequent symptoms, like fatigue (51%, 95% CI: 34%-68%), dyspnea (30%, 95% CI: 21%-40%), and cough (67%, 95% CI: 59%-76%)
25
can also be manifestations of decompensated HF or arrhythmic syndrome. Corroborating this concern, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) reported that among SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed cases, cardiovascular symptoms were the first presentation in some patients. The problem behind these atypical presentations is that patients suffering from heart palpitations and chest tightness rather than respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough, had a delayed COVID-19 diagnosis.
26
Still according to the NHC, among the people who died from COVID-19, 11.8% had substantial heart damage, with elevated troponin I levels or cardiac arrest during hospitalization.
26

Explanatory theories regarding COVID-19 cardiovascular affection postulate that chronic cardiovascular diseases may become unstable in the setting of a viral infection as a consequence of the imbalance between the infection-induced increase in metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve.
2
This imbalance, concurrent with an accentuated inflammatory response and myocardial damage, could raise the risk of acute coronary syndromes, HF, and arrhythmias.

The deleterious SARS-CoV-2 infection myocardial effects could also be perpetuated by the prompt and severe downregulation of myocardial and pulmonary ACE2 pathways, thereby mediating myocardial inflammation, lung edema, and acute respiratory failure.
27
ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2-related signaling pathways might even have a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and 2 T-helper cells,
20
,
28
strong interferon-mediated immunopathological events,
29
and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia caused by COVID-19, resulting in damage to myocardial cells. Therapeutic use of corticosteroids, in this context, would further augment the possibility of adverse cardiovascular events.

Regarding hypoxemia caused by COVID-19, it is relevant to highlight that this condition can trigger atrial fibrillation, which is the most common arrhythmia among elderly individuals, and that atrial fibrillation can become persistent even before pulmonary improvement. Furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response would make anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation very complex.
30

1.3 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine side effects on cardiovascular system

Another essential aspect to be discussed is about chloroquine cardiovascular side effects since this is one of the promising drugs that have been tested in patients with COVID-19. It is well-reported that long-term chloroquine use may increase depolarization length duration and Purkinje fiber refractory period,
31
-
34
ultimately leading to atrioventricular nodal and/or His system malfunction.
31

As an antimalarial drug, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are accumulated in lysosomes, directly inhibiting phospholipase activity, inducing cytoplasmic inclusion body formation, increasing lysosomal pH, and causing protein inactivity.
31
,
35
Due to these properties, drug-induced atrial and VAs have been associated with their use.
31
-
35
The most usual electrocardiographic alteration is fascicular block, which can lead to advanced types of atrioventricular block, generally associated with syncope.
36

HCQ can also induce QT interval prolongation, an extremely rare but potential fatal side effect, due to the risk of induced polymorphic VT and SCD. The proposed mechanism by which HCQ causes QT interval prolongation is not well understood. In 2015, Capel et al demonstrated, in guinea pig sinoatrial node myocytes, an inhibitory effect of the HCQ on the hyperpolarization-activated current ion channels (also known as ""funny current"" channels), along with delayed rectifier potassium currents, and L-type calcium ion currents.
37
Inhibitory effects on pacemaker cells were shown to cause delayed rates in depolarization leading to decreased heart rates. These findings may correlate with a proposed mechanism by which refractory action potentials in cardiac myocytes may lead to prolongation of QT interval due to delayed depolarization and repolarization from abnormal ion currents.
38
QT prolongation in individual medical therapy is not always predictable, dose adjustments and/or additional monitoring with electrocardiograms may be appropriate in some cases. HCQ proarrhythmic risk must be monitored in patients with underlying cardiovascular or renal disorders, and high caution should be posed in the case of electrolyte imbalance, dysrhythmias or concurrent use of QTc-prolonging drugs.
38

2 CONCLUSION

Acute lung injury is a common problem in patients with COVID-19 and results in significant morbidity and mortality. However, increasing clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection is associated with myocardial injury and arrhythmic complications.

Even though the prevalence of COVID-19 arrhythmogenic effects has yet not been reported, close cardiovascular surveillance is advisable, particularly in patients with more severe presentation and in those with increased baseline risk due to previous cardiac comorbidities. Since many medications are being used empirically to treat the infection and/or symptoms, there is a need to increase awareness to possible drug interactions and close monitoring in atrioventricular conduction and QT interval.

Abstract

Abstract

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) represents the third human affliction attributed to the highly pathogenic coronavirus in the current century. Due to its highly contagious nature and unprecedented global spread, its aggressive clinical presentation and the lack of effective treatment, SARS-CoV-2 infection is causing the losses of thousands of lives and imparting unparalleled strains on healthcare systems around the world. In the current report, we discuss perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and provide clinicians with recommendations to effectively triage and plan these procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak. This will help reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers and allocate resources appropriately to those in greatest need. We include an algorithm for preoperative testing for COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, and a classification system to categorize and prioritize common cardiac surgery procedures.

Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution. The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe. Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection. This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus. Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.

1 INTRODUCTION

CoVs were recognized as ""novel respiratory tract viruses"" over half a century ago. The title was conferred in 1962, following the examination of samples collected from individuals who had manifested symptoms of respiratory tract infection (Hamre & Procknow,
1966
). Initially, CoVs were not considered as highly pathogenic for humans. That was until 2002, however, that CoVs emerged in the form of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the Guangdong state of China (Sahin et al.,
2020
). Almost a decade later, another highly pathogenic CoV appeared in the Middle East countries, which similarly led to severe respiratory symptoms of acute onset. The then-novel species was named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Zaki, Van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier,
2012
).

In December 2019, a cluster of insidious Coronavirus infections was reported in the Huanan Seafood Market, located in Wuhan State of Hubei Province in China. Unlike the name, livestock animals were also traded in the market alongside their marine relatives. Days later, the cluster turned into a local network and set off the alarm for the Chinese government. It was then that a pneumonia epidemic of unknown cause became the focus of global attention (Sahin et al.,
2020
). Chinese authorities announced on January 7, 2020 that a new type of CoV (novel CoV, nCoV) was isolated (Imperial College London,
2020
; World Health Organization,
2020
). On December 12, 2019, a pneumonia case of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, China. Initial laboratory tests ruled out Influenza and infection with recognized CoVs. Following the incident, 27 new cases of pneumonia of viral origin were officially reported on December 31, 2019. A week later on January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities announced that a new species of CoV was isolated in the country (Zumla, Hui, Azhar, Memish, & Maeurer,
2020
).

Given the whereabouts of the first case ever reported, the infection was speculated to have been contracted from a zoonotic agent. Etiologic investigations on patients who had been hospitalized with a similar medical history supported the likelihood of a viral infection transmitted from animals to humans (Sahin et al.,
2020
; World Health Organization,
2020
; Yin & Wunderink,
2018
). nCoV was duly reported to have been originated from wild bats. Falling in the category of group 2 b-CoVs, the novel Coronavirus only shares a 70% similarity in genetic sequence with its predecessor, SARS-CoV, which also belongs to the exact same family (Gralinski & Menachery,
2020
).

The tantalizing surge in the number of cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China, despite the closure of markets and evacuation of the vicinity, fulfilled the burden of proof that the virus can also be transmitted from human to human. Soon thereafter, peculiar cases of acute respiratory syndrome started appearing in other Asian countries, ultimately spreading to North America and Europe. (Sahin et al.,
2020
; World Health Organization,
2020
; Yin & Wunderink,
2018
). Following an emergent briefing on January 30, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Organization,
2020
).

The epidemic began to emerge with the advent of the Chinese New Year, a traditionally important festival that is heavily celebrated across the country. The coincidence paved the way for SARS-CoV-2 to turn into an unprecedented massive Coronavirus outbreak, which required extensive measurements to be contained. With a population of 10 million, Wuhan City also served as an important pathway for millions of people traveling in celebration of the Spring Festival. Accordingly, the number of cases to be diagnosed with COVID-19 showed an overwhelming increase between January 10-22, 2020 (Chen, Zhang et al.,
2020
).

Despite the arbitrary speculations, not only did the recent outbreak of COVID-19 egress the country of origin, it also proceeded to become a global concern in the form of a pandemic (Yang et al.,
2020
). COVID-19 is an acute self-resolving respiratory disease in most of the cases, however, it can also be fatal in some cases. The disease was initially reported to have a mortality rate of 2%. If severe, COVID-19 might result in death as a result of the preceding extensive alveolar damage, and failure of the lungs (Xu et al.,
2020
). As of February 15, 2020, a total of 66,580 cases had been confirmed, with over 1,524 deaths. However, there have no specific reports on pathology, as performing an autopsy or biopsy was not possible in most of the cases (Chan et al.,
2020
; Huang et al.,
2020
). Table

A total of 8,096 SARS cases and 774 deaths across 29 countries were reported for an overall case-fatality rate (CFR) of 9.6%. MERS is still not contained and is thus far responsible for 2,494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths across 27 countries for a CFR of 34.4%. Despite the much higher CFR of 9.6% and 34.4% for SARS and MERS, the novel Coronavirus epidemic has led to a larger death toll. The Chinese government had reported 72,528 confirmed cases, with 1,870 deaths, as of February 18, 2020. These statistics yield a crude CFR of 2.6%. However, one should not haste to generalize this number, as most possibly the total number of patients with COVID-19 is much higher. That is, because the cases are not readily identifiable, as many asymptomatic patients are missed during the process (Wu et al.,
2020
; Yan et al.,
2020
). Despite the higher transmissibility than SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is still a relatively unknown disease and requires further investigations to be fully understood (Yan et al.,
2020
).

2 PATHOGENESIS

Initially, the virus interacts with sensitive human cells that exhibit distinct receptors for the viral Spike protein. After making a successful entry, the RNA-based genome starts replicating itself, and expressing specific sequences that results in production of useful accessory proteins; facilitating the adaptation of CoV to its human host (ViralZone.,
2019
). Alterations in genetic make-up that result from recombination, exchange, insertion, or deletion of genes, are frequently reported among CoVs; a phenomenon that might have played a part in the past epidemics (Sahin et al.,
2020
). Therefore, the classification of CoVs is continuously being changed. Based on the most recent classification provided by The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, there are four genera of CoVs, that comprise a total of 38 unique species (Subissi et al.,
2014
). Thus, variable mechanisms could be involved in the process of pathogenesis. For instance, SARS-CoV binds to angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). On the other hand, MERS-CoV is more inclined to attach the cellular receptor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Lambeir, Durinx, Scharpe, & De Meester,
2003
). Following a cascade of signals after binding, the viral genome is successfully injected into the target cell. The genomic RNA that regulates the expression of structural and nonstructural polyproteins, is polyadenylated and encapsulated. These proteins are then cleaved by certain proteases that exhibit chymotrypsin-like activity (Lambeir et al.,
2003
; ViralZone,
2019
). Through replication and transcription, the resulting protein complex drives the production of negative-sense RNA or (-) RNA. Full-length (-)RNAs produced by replication are ultimately used as templates for generation of positive-sense RNA or (+) RNA (Luk, Li, Fung, Lau, & Woo,
2019
; ViralZone,
2019
). All of the structural proteins are then translated from a subset of 7-9 subgenomic RNAs, which are products of discontinuous transcription. The resulting protein complex is the assembled together to envelope the viral genome, making a nucleocapsid in the process, that will bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum to finally complete the intracellular cycle. Newly formed virions are then expelled from the infected cell through exocytosis. The CoVs released thereafter are now capable to infect a wide spectrum of human cells, including lung, renal, hepatic, intestinal, and lower respiratory tract cells, as well as T lymphocytes (Chhikara, Rathi, Singh, & Poonam,
2020
; Lambeir et al.,
2003
). Figure

Presents a schematic of viral structure and the entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2

2.1 Respiratory system

SARS-CoV-2 tends to infect the respiratory tract, thus, pneumonia is a primary clinical finding in patients with COVID-19 (Huang et al.,
2020
; Li, Guan, et al.,
2020
; Zhu et al.,
2020
). However, pneumonia is only a component of the SARS that might develop in some cases. The resulting SARS may then be aggravated and lead to serious conditions that are extremely difficult to control, for example, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction (Kofi Ayittey, Dzuvor, Kormla Ayittey, Bennita Chiwero, & Habib,
2020
).

Investigation on the radiological findings of COVID-19-associated pneumonia have yielded little, if any, information that are mostly unspecific. Progressive lung lesions are usually detected in patients with COVID-19, about 1 week after the onset of signs and symptoms (Ooi et al.,
2004
). The lesions then become aggravated during the 2nd week, and lead to formation of irregular reticular opacities mixed with ground glass opacities (GGOs), which can be detected by CT at the fourth week. In a recent cohort study, 85.7% (54/63) of subjects with COVID-19-associated pneumonia showed disease progression, defined by an increased extent of GGO, on early follow-up CT (Pan et al.,
2020
). Pulmonary fibrous cords was reported in one particular patient that displayed signs of improvement, as the inflammatory secretions had been absorbed (Pan & Guan,
2020
). Long-term complications of COVID-19 in patients with severe pneumonia might include an array of fibrotic changes often observed in the late stages of lung injury, for example, reticulation, interlobular septal thickening, and traction bronchiectasis (Kim,
2020
).

2.2 Immune system

There have been several reports that indicated meager Cytolethal Distending Toxin-induced lymphocytes, with a density as low as 200 cells/mm
3
in three patients with SARS-CoV infection (Chu et al.,
2014
; Zhou et al.,
2014
). As in the case of SARS-CoV-2, it has been suspected that infection with this type of CoV might lead to inflammatory cytokine storm (Chen, Liu, et al.,
2020
; Zumla et al.,
2020
); a life-threatening condition characterized by elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in plasma. A number of investigations recently conducted on COVID-19 have reported that IL-6 levels was actually higher in the patients with severe disease (Cai,
2020
; Chen, Liu, et al.,
2020
; Xiang et al.,
2020
). This could highlight the importance of IL-6 as a biomarker for evaluation of disease severity (Chen, Zhao, et al.,
2020
).

2.3 Liver damage

Impaired liver function tests have been reported for a number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting hepatic damage as an extrapulmonary complication of COVID-19 in almost one half of the patients (Chen, Zhou, et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). A recent study has concluded that liver function abnormality might stem from infection of bile duct cells with SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, the alkaline phosphatase value, which is an index of bile duct damage, were not specific in patients with COVID-19 (Chen, Zhou, et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). Investigation of liver biopsy specimens was accompanied by new pathological findings. Scientists have reported moderate microvascular steatosis, and mild lobular and portal activity in these patients, that suggests liver damage may have arisen from either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver (Xu et al.,
2020
).

An essential player in maintenance of electrolyte balance and blood pressure, ACE2 is regarded by many as the principal counter-regulatory arm in the axis of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS; Santos, Ferreira, & Simoes e Silva,
2008
). Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2. This results in degradation of ACE2, which subsequently dampens the counter-effect of ACE2 on RAAS. The final effect of ACE2 in an otherwise healthy adult is to increase reabsorption of sodium and the reciprocal excretion of potassium ions (K
+
). The concomitant re-uptake of water with sodium reabsorption prompts an increase in blood pressure (Weir & Rolfe,
2010
). Potassium is the predominant intracellular ion, that is majorly involved in regulation of cell membrane polarity. Too low levels of K+ in blood, known as hypokalemia, can result in cellular hyper-polarity. A hyper-polarized cell membrane tends to be depolarized faster than normal, causing aberrancy in the function of cardiac cells (Bielecka-Dabrowa et al.,
2012
).

In a recent cohort study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorized into three groups: severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia. The study reported that 93% of patients with a severe clinical condition had hypokalemia. Scientists did not find a direct link between gastrointestinal symptoms and hypokalemia among 108 patients with both severe or moderate hypokalemia. Further investigations established an association between parameters such as body temperature, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) with the severity of hypokalemia. Reportedly, hypokalemia was most often observed with patients who had elevated levels of serum CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Potassium (K
+
) loss in the urine was determined to be the primary cause of hypokalemia.

Hypokalemia requires strenuous efforts to be corrected. This is chiefly due to the incessant loss of K
+
in the urine, as a result of ACE2 degradation. In the case of COVID-19-associated hypokalemia, however, the patients seemed to respond well to potassium supplements when the critical phase had passed [49]. Therefore, one should consider the impact of hypokalemia in COVID-19 morbidity, and its effect on the outcomes of treatment. This is a condition that must be carefully addressed for, as patients with COVID-19 are more inclined to develop dysfunctions in heart, lungs, and other vital organs (Li, Hu, Su, & Dai,
2020
).

3 POSSIBLE FACTORS CORRELATED WITH COVID-19

3.1 Sex

Several studies have sought to compare the sex differences in the clinical findings of severe COVID-19. In one study, scientists investigated 47 patients with COVID-19, 28 (59.6%) of whom were men. Procalcitonin (PCT) level was reported to be higher in men than in women. The results also showed higher amounts of serum N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide, as increased levels of the molecule were detected in men 57.1% than women 26.3%. Furthermore, 17.9% of male patients were reported test-positive for influenza A antibody, whereas no such records were registered for female patients. During a 2-week stay at the hospital, 17.9% of male, and 5.3% of female patients deteriorated, and hence were reassigned to the critical-type group. There was no mortality reports among women, whereas 3.6% of male patients had deceased due to COVID-19 complications. A total of 21.1% and 3.6% of female and male patients successfully recovered, and were discharged from the hospital. Based on the current evidence, men are more likely to develop complications, and experience worse in-hospital outcomes compared with women (Li, Zhang, et al.,
2020
).

3.2 Pregnancy

A group of researchers led by Chen investigated the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nine pregnant women. Their aim was to evaluate the likelihood of intrauterine/vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to baby. All of the women who were being investigated had cesarean section in the third trimester of their previous pregnancies. Seven patients were febrile, and variably presented other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, myalgia, and malaise. Fetal distress was reported in two cases. Lymphopenia and increased aminotransferase activity were observed in five and three patients, respectively. There was no mortality cases, as none of the patients in the study developed severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Nine livebirths were recorded. The newborns displayed no signs of asphyxia. A 1-min Apgar score of 8-9, and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10 were calculated for all nine newborns. Samples collected from six patients, including amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk proved test-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The clinical features of COVID-19-associated pneumonia observed in these pregnant women shared a great similarity to characteristics reported for COVID-19-associated pneumonia in nonpregnant adult patients (Chen, Guo, et al.,
2020
).

3.3 Blood type

In a recent investigation, scientists in China looked into the pattern of blood type distribution in 2,173 patients in three hospitals, who had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, they compared their findings regarding the blood type of patients with that of the healthy population who lived in the same area as the patients in the study. Apparently, there was a higher prevalence of blood type A among the patients with COVID-19 than in the normal population. On the contrary, it seemed that individuals with O blood type were spared somehow, as there were fewer patients with this blood type in this study (both
p
< .001). A series of meta-analyses on the available data indicated a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 in people with blood type A, relative to individuals with non-A blood types. However, an opposite scenario seemed to be true for the blood type O community, since, according to the literature, are less susceptible for contracting infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (Zhao et al.,
2020
).

4 ETIOLOGY: SOURCES AND MODES OF TRANSMISSION

According to the literature, the pathogen and area of origin were similar in both SARS and COVID-19 outbreaks. However, despite this similarity, the raised public awareness and extensive interventional procedures that might have once proved effective for SARS containment, have been rendered ineffective against the 2019 novel Coronavirus; as the disease is already more widespread than SARS (Liu, Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rocklov,
2020
). A large family of viruses, CoVs are common among many different animal species, including cattle, civets, camels, and bats. However, these CoVs are not solely restricted to animal populations, as they can occasionally infect humans, bringing epidemics such as SARS, MERS, and in recent memory, COVID-19 (Sahin et al.,
2020
). Recent investigations conducted on the origins of CoVs responsible for the past epidemics have reported bats as the primary reservoir for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; suggesting that other animal species were involved in the process merely as intermediate hosts. Accordingly, the majority of bat-associated CoVs belong to a-CoV and b-CoV genera, while almost all of the avian CoVs fall in the other two genera; g-CoVs and d-CoVs (Yin & Wunderink,
2018
). It has been suggested that species responsible for the recent epidemic is reminiscent of the CoV isolated in bats. Trafficking of wild animals in Huanan Seafood Market, located in Wuhan State of Hubei Province in China, where the first cases were reported, further supports this finding. Only 10 days following the first outbreak, secondary cases started emerging. Although the new cases had no contact with the marketplace, they did have a history of social contact with the salesmen and people who had previously been there. The growing pile of confirmed cases from healthcare workers in Wuhan City is an strong indicator of human-to-human transmission in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (Sahin et al.,
2020
).

Transmission of the virus from human to human occurs mostly with close contact. The short distance between individuals in close social contacts makes it possible for respiratory droplets of the infected person, released by coughing and sneezing, to reach other people in the proximity. This is similar to the transmission of Influenza and other respiratory infection. It still remains unclear if the virus can be contracted by touching surfaces, and then touching mouth, nose, or even eyes (WHO,
2020
). Apparently, COVID-19 is considered most contagious when individuals infected with the virus is symptomatic. However, there have been cases who reportedly had contracted the disease from asymptomatic patients in the prodrome period of COVID-19. Transmission of the novel Coronavirus has yet to be clarified by more investigations. (Rothe et al.,
2020
).

4.1 Presumed asymptomatic carrier-based transmission of COVID-19

Investigation on a familial cluster of five patients concluded that SARS-CoV-2 might have actually been transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier in the family (Bai et al.,
2020
). Surprisingly, the first reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the asymptomatic family member was reported negative; a noteworthy example of a false-negative result. Unwanted false-negative results are inevitably reported due to a number of factors, for example, quality of the test kit, sufficiency of the collected sample, or performance of the test by clinicians. To this date, RT-PCR has widely been used as a reliable diagnostic method (Corman et al.,
2020
). Thus, her second RT-PCR result, reported positive, was unlikely to have been a false-positive result; hence, it was accepted as the definite evidence that the suspected person had indeed been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Bai et al.,
2020
).

There was also another study that reported an asymptomatic young boy with COVID-19 infection. However, CT scans obtained from the subject exhibited abnormalities, indicative of an on-going pulmonary pathology (Chan et al.,
2020
). If we presume that the findings regarding asymptomatic carrier-based transmission of COVID-19 can be replicated, this would prove COVID-19 an overwhelmingly challenging issue to be controlled (Bai et al.,
2020
). The incubation period for the asymptomatic patient in the case of familial cluster was 19 days. Despite being a long period, it still perfectly falls in the suggested incubation period of 0-24 days (Bai et al.,
2020
; Guan et al.,
2020
).

5 DIAGNOSIS

A proper diagnosis of COVID-19 is made based on the following criteria, which have been recently suggested based on the initial investigations: (a) clinical signs and symptoms, (b) history of traveling or close contact with people suspected to be infected, (c) positive test result for the pathogen, and (d) pathologic findings on CT images. The key clinical features of COVID-19, though nonspecific, include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia (Chen, Zhou, et al.,
2020
; Huang et al.,
2020
; Li, Guan, et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). Rapid screening of patients with acute respiratory symptoms, initiation of an appropriate quarantine program, and development of therapeutic measures have been suggested as a top-priority strategy to control the spread of COVID-19 (Tian et al.,
2020
; Wang, Kang, et al.,
2020
). According to the data gathered by individual-level surveillance, it is strongly recommended that the elderly and male patients should be diagnosed in a timely manner, as progression of the respiratory pathology to pneumonia might result in catastrophic outcomes (Jian-ya,
2020
).

5.1 Clinical symptom spectrum

Understanding the otherwise nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 is a crucial step toward appropriate management of the disease. Patients mostly complain of fever, non-productive cough, and body ache or extreme tiredness. In some cases, diarrhea and nausea precede fever by a few days, suggesting that fever might not be the initial manifestation of infection. A small number of patients reportedly had headache, or even developed hemoptysis (Guan et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). Some patients remained asymptomatic, despite being tested positive for the disease (Chan et al.,
2020
). According to several studies, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly, especially the male community, is more likely to result in severe alveolar damage and respiratory failure (Chen, Zhou, et al.,
2020
). Occasionally, the disease may be demonstrated with a fulminant natural history, rapidly progressing to organ dysfunction, and even death in critical cases. Organ dysfunction includes conditions such as shock, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury (Huang et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). From a laboratory point of view, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, impaired prothrombin time (PT), and elevated serum levels of CRP stand among the findings that can be reported for patients with COVID-19 (Chen, Zhou, et al.,
2020
; Guan et al.,
2020
; Huang et al.,
2020
; Wang, Hu, et al.,
2020
). Overall, any patient with fever and acute respiratory symptoms, who is reported to have lymphopenia or leukopenia on lab examination, should be suspected. A history of travel to Wuhan or having close contact with local residents is a strong indicator for careful management of the patient (Zu et al.,
2020
). Table
2
represents the criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients (Committee,
2020b
; Zu et al.,
2020
;
WWW.ClinicalTrials.gov
).

5.2 Epidemiological history

Shortly after the onset of the epidemic, The National Health Commission of China (Committee,
2020a
; Organization,
2020a
) initiated the Diagnosis and Treatment Program of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, following the guidelines provided by WHO on SARS and MERS (Azhar & EI-Kafrawy,
2014
; Organization,
2017
,
2020b
).

According to the newly formulated criteria, a ""suspected case"" is defined as a patient with epidemiological history, that is traveling and contact, and two clinical findings pertinent to the disease. If, however, an epidemiological history is not confirmed, then the patient must present at least three clinical findings to be considered as a suspected case. Based on the Trial, Fifth Edition (Committee,
2020b
), pathologic findings indicative of viral pneumonia on chest CT scans provide enough evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Nonetheless, as of February 17, 2020, WHO does not approve of any diagnosis based solely on radiologic findings, without obtaining an RT-PCR test from the patient (Organization,
2020c
). In the more recent revision of the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Program, 6th Edition, the term ""clinical diagnosis"" was removed and replaced with ""etiological diagnosis"" (Organization,
2020a
). According to the recent revision, it is imperative that an etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is made at first, which can then be complemented by a positive real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, which is duly performed on the sputum or blood sample of the patient. After the final diagnosis is made, confirmed patients are categorized into mild, moderate, severe, and critical types, based on the severity of disease (Zu et al.,
2020
).

NCT04304690/Recruiting, Mar16-Oct16 2020

5.3.1 Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction

Despite being the diagnostic gold standard, pathogenic lab testing is a rather time-consuming procedure, with unavoidable false-positive results (Wang, Kang, et al.,
2020
). It is recommended that lab testing should be performed, as soon as the patient is identified as a ""person under investigation"" (PUI). Viral nucleic acid required for an RT-PCR test is usually extracted from secretions of the lower respiratory tract, for example, bronchoalveolar lavage; however, tracheal aspirate or sputum can also be used (Chu et al.,
2020
; Corman et al.,
2020
). Since the onset of the epidemic, several factors have been found to affect the final efficiency of nucleic acid testing, that is, availability, quality, stability, and reproducibility of detection kits. In most of the cases, the tests need to be repeated for several times (Wang, Kang, et al.,
2020
), as the estimated detection rate of the test falls in an underwhelming range of 30-50% (Chu et al.,
2020
; Corman et al.,
2020
; Zhang et al.,
2020
). In spite of being a valuable asset, the undesirable false-negative results of RT-PCR have prompted careful clinical and etiological evaluation of COVID-19 in suspected cases as the first-line diagnostic method (Zu et al.,
2020
).

5.3.2 Computed tomography (CT)

CT has proved to be of great value in diagnosis of the COVID-19-associated pneumonia, as it provides major evidence, that cannot readily be obtained with alternative methods. It is true that CT is a reliable imaging modality in subtle detection of viral pneumonia and screening of suspected cases; however, it should be noted that many pulmonary diseases of inflammatory nature share similar radiographic findings (Wang, Kang, et al.,
2020
). The majority of patients with COVID-19 present with GGO in their chest CT, which later progress into multilobar consolidations. There have been several reports of rounded opacities, which are sometimes peripherally distributed in the lung (Chung et al.,
2020
; Huang et al.,
2020
). In contrast to CT, plain chest radiography (CXR) has not been recommended as a first-line imaging method, because this modality does not provide the clarity viewed on CT scans, especially in the early stages of pulmonary infection (Ng et al.,
2020
). Nevertheless, CXR is capable of recording pathologic changes in patients with severely progressed COVID-19, as the bilateral multifocal consolidations present in these patients are too dense to be missed. The notorious ""white lung"" appearance can be optimally viewed on CXRs of critically ill patients (Zu et al.,
2020
). CT resulted in diagnosis of 14,840 new cases as of February 13, 2020 (Zu et al.,
2020
). Therefore, slice chest CT is an adequately sensitive and reliable method in early detection of pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 (Chan et al.,
2020
; Ng et al.,
2020
).

5.3.3 Novel approaches: Artificial intelligence-based technologies

Depp learning, as a novel AI-based modality might be able to analyze radiographic features of COVID-19, and help clinicians provide an accurate clinical diagnosis based on a precedented pattern (Wang, Kang, et al.,
2020
). As part of recent advancements, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a class of deep neural networks, has been shown to be capable of medical image analysis. To this date, CNN has been successfully employed in investigations on the nature of pulmonary nodules reported in CT images, diagnosis of pneumonia in children based on CXR, and image recognition in cystoscopy videos (Choe et al.,
2019
; Kermany et al.,
2018
; Negassi, Suarez-Ibarrola, Hein, Miernik, & Reiterer,
2020
; Wang et al.,
2018
).

The 21st century has seen many AI-based models to be incorporated in several scientific fields, particularly imaging studies. Diagnostic AI-based models might actually be a forward leap in tasks that simply cannot be handled by manpower, especially risk prioritization, that can greatly help improve patient turnaround time. Given the shortage of human resources and inadequate number of hospital beds in a country like China, AI-based models for analysis of CXR and CT scans can be useful in ruling out irrelevant cases, and resource-wise admission of patients to the hospitals (Kim,
2020
).

6 PREDICTION

Recent studies focused on prognosis of COVID-19 concluded that the load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood (RNAemia) is correlated with Cytokine Release Storm (CRS) and poor prognosis of the disease. In one particular study, scientists used Generalized Linear Models to generate a prediction model for natural history of disease based on the
C
t
value of real-time RT-PCR results. They reported that traceable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood plasma of 15% of COVID-19 positive patients enrolled at the study. Their findings drew a direct link between serum markers and disease severity, as RNAemia and high levels of IL-6 (nearly 10-fold) were exclusively reported in critically ill patients. Interestingly, there was also an association between the extremely high levels of IL-6 with the incidence of RNAemia (
R
= 0.902) in patients. Findings also suggested that vital signs of patients were also affected by high levels of both serum markers (
R
= 0.682). According to this study, IL-6 might be of clinical value in identification and treatment of patients with an excessive inflammatory response (Chen, Zhao, et al.,
2020
). Table
3
(Chen, Zhao, et al.,
2020
; Yan et al.,
2020
) and Table
4
represent 2020 studies on prognosis of COVID-19 infected patients and related clinical trials, respectively.

7.1 Chloroquine phosphate

Chloroquine phosphate is an old medicine, that has been widely used for treatment of malaria in endemic regions. It is also a salutary treatment of choice for certain progressive anti-inflammatory diseases, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Recently, an investigation in China reported that remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate were effective experimental agents for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab (Chen et al.,
2013
). Initial findings reported by a recent study on effectiveness of therapeutic agents in management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggested successful application of chloroquine phosphate in treatment of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Following the promising results, scientists recommended chloroquine phosphate to be included in treatment regimen of COVID-19 patients with severe involvement of the lungs (Yu et al.,
2013
). On February 15, 2020, participants from different organizations, including medical experts and authorities, made an agreement on potency of Chloroquine phosphate against SARS-CoV-2 infection (
https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/coronavirus-mers-cov-drugs/
).

So far, close monitoring of over 100 patients, who were under treatment of chloroquine phosphate, has provided further evidence regarding the effectiveness of this long-known medicine. Investigations indicated that chloroquine phosphate prevented exacerbation of pneumonia in these patients, improved their chest CT findings, and shortened the otherwise long natural course of the disease. Importantly, there have been no records of severe reaction or hypersensitivity to this therapeutic agent. It has been suggested that the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of chloroquine phosphate lies within the complicated pharmacodynamics of the drug that results in a basic shift in the endosomal pH required for successful fusion of virus onto the host cell. chloroquine phosphate also seems to have disruptive effects on glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV (Yin & Wunderink,
2018
; Zumla et al.,
2020
), rendering them nonfunctional. It also interferes with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, a signaling event involved in replication of HCoV-229E (Kono et al.,
2008
).

7.2 Lopinavir/ritonavir, leronlimab, galidesivir

Lopinavir/Ritonavir, commonly used for treatment of HIV infection, has been indicated for treatment of COVID-19 in a number of reports (Kim et al.,
2020
). Previous studies suggested that when combined together, Lopinavir and Ritonavir act in concert to hinder further replication of SARS-CoV, and improve the clinical status of patients with SARS (Chu et al.,
2004
). This might also mean that the well-known antiretroviral duo can also prove beneficial in treatment of COVID-19.

Other candidates for possible management of SARS-CoV-2 include Leronlimab and Galidesivir, both of which have been of clinical value in treatment of several fatal viral infections, and were shown to improve the survival of patients. Leronlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (CCR5 antagonist). Galidesivir, on the other hand, belongs to the family of nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors (
https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/coronavirus-mers-cov-drugs/
). In the absence of any specific therapeutic agents to quell SARs-CoV-2, it might be a salutary strategy to repurpose the already available medicine, and include them in treatment of COVID-19 (Tian et al.,
2020
).

7.3 RAAS inhibitors

ACE2 is a prominent regulatory arm in the RAAS axis, thus, a disruption in ACE-Angiotensin II-Angiotensin Type 1 Receptor (AT1R), and ACE2/Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas Receptor axes can result in multisystem inflammation. Increased levels of ACE and Angiotensin II in plasma are considered poor prognostic factors in severe pneumonia. Several studies on animal models have reported effectiveness of RAAS inhibitors in alleviation of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. In the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 binding, the enzyme is eventually degraded, hence, the inhibition of ACE2/Angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas Receptor pathway. Accordingly, it is assumed that ACE and AT1R inhibitors might be game-changing agents that can especially be administered for COVID-19 patients who have serious impairments in their homeostasis. Maintenance of homeostasis may ultimately result in suppression of the inflammatory response, mostly in the pulmonary tissue (Sun, Yang, Sun, & Su,
2020
).

7.4 Combination therapy

Combination therapy is a more extensive and rigorous approach mainly aimed at correction of life-threatening events such as shock, hypoxemia, secondary or super infection, and maintenance of homeostasis, that is, electrolyte, acid and base balance. As a palliative practice, antiviral treatment in the early stages of COVID-19 might lessen the severity and prevent further progression of the disease. Trials on combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (umifenovir) have reported satisfactory results in treatment of COVID-19. Alongside a proper antiviral treatment, patients may also benefit from an artificial liver blood purification system, which is capable of rapidly removing the inflammatory factors from blood, thus, halting the disastrous cytokine release syndrome. This system can also facilitate the sustenance of critically ill patients by preserving the balance of bodily fluid. Administration of glucocorticoids in moderate doses is another intervention that has recently been indicated for patients with severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia. However, secondary fungal infection should be considered. Patients with an oxygenation index of less than 200 mmHg might benefit more from oxygen therapy than noninvasive ventilation. A rational prescription of antimicrobial medicines has been cautioned only for patients with remittent fever and elevated antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever, and elevated PCT levels. Ultimately, to maintain the balance of intestinal microbiota, oral intake of prebiotics or probiotics has been suggested. This can reduce the risk of secondary infections as a result of microbial translocation; however, effectiveness of such interventions on postinfection clearance pattern of SARS-CoV-2 has not been studied (Xu et al.,
2020
).

7.5 Other future possible options

7.5.1 Convalescent blood therapy

A conspicuously conventional method, transfusion of human convalescent plasma, might be viewed as a beneficial strategy for prevention and even treatment of COVID-19. The method is as facile as its age since it only requires an adequate number of recovered patients who are willing to donate their immunoglobulin-containing serum. Although one still might argue the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection via convalescent blood transfusion, no such incident with SARS-CoV was reported by WHO amidst the outbreak of the disease in 2003. The heft of past experience should come to mind once it is noted that the majority of approaches and therapeutic strategies that are currently being tested for COVID-19 are derived from clinical experience in treatment of SARS, MERS, and other correspondents viral epidemics (Casadevall & Pirofski,
2020
; Cunningham, Goh, & Koh,
2020
).

7.5.2 Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy

A new therapeutic for treating immune-mediated diseases, MSC therapy might have the capability to terminate the inappropriate release of cytokines in COVID-19. Through its anti-inflammatory effects, MSC therapy has been reported to improve respiratory function in murine models with acute lung injury. Evidence suggests that MSCs might be doing so by repressing the aberrant release of inflammatory factors (Hu & Li,
2018
; Wang, Yao, Lv, Ling, & Li,
2017
; Xiang et al.,
2017
). In particular, a study by Chinese scientists concluded that transplantation of MSCs could be considered as a novel approach in treatment of viral pneumonia, noting promissory implications of this method in management of H7N9-induced ARDS. Since H7N9 and SARS-CoV-2 can result in similar complications, for example, ARDS and respiratory failure, MSC-based therapy might lead to a new path in treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia (Chen, Hu, et al.,
2020
).

7.5.3 Nano drug delivery systems

It has long been known that the traditional circulation-based delivery of therapeutic agents is not as effect, prompting pharmaceutical industries to develop novel platforms for delivery of molecules to hard-to-reach tissues in human body. Conjugation of antiviral agents, particularly nucleoside analogs, with specific nanoparticles has proved to be effectual in treatment of resistant HIV infection (Agarwal, Chhikara, Doncel, & Parang,
2017
; Agarwal, Chhikara, Quiterio, Doncel, & Parang,
2012
). Today, an appreciable number of drug delivery platforms based on nanotechnology are available that can be experimentally used with custom therapeutic formulations for treatment of COVID-19 (Chhikara & Varma,
2019
) in hopes of shortening the course of the disease (Chhikara et al.,
2020
).

7.5.4 Psychological interventions

Progression of COVID-19, similar to any other disease, can result in suffering of the patients, prompting psychological symptoms, which will require special interventions. It has been well-established today that individuals who fall victim to public health emergencies, for example, disease outbreaks, develop variable degrees of stress disorders. The problem persists even after the individual has recovered and discharged from the hospital (Cheng, Wong, Tsang, & Wong,
2004
; Fan, Long, Zhou, Zheng, & Liu,
2015
). With that in mind, one should consider several factors for classification of patients who will most probably benefit from psychological interventions; that is overall course of the disease, severity, and quality of hospitalization (e.g., home, ordinary wards, ICU, etc.) (Duan & Zhu,
2020
).

In large-scale outbreaks such as COVID-19 epidemic, healthcare workers become the frontline at providing psychological cares for patients who battle against the disease. Primary medical and mental care should be provided for those individuals who are recognized as ""suspected case"" and duly quarantined at home. (Duan & Zhu,
2020
).

Interventions should be discreetly formulated following a thorough evaluation of risk factors involved in emerging of these psychological issues, including a history of impaired mental health, bereavement after a deceased family member, panic, separation from loved ones, and a low income (Kun, Han, Chen, Yao, & Anxiety,
2009
).

8 PATIENTS RECOVERED FROM COVID-19

The following criteria must be met in order for a patient to be discharged from hospital or released from quarantine: (a) having been afebrile for at least 3 consecutive days, (b) remission of respiratory distress, (c) regression of infiltrations/consolidations on chest CT images, and two consecutive negative reports of RT-PCR test performed at least 1 day apart (d). Despite these thoroughly formulated criteria, one study reported positive RT-PCR test results 5-13 days after hospital discharge for four patients with COVID-19, who met all of the criteria above before they were discharged. These findings are important in that they imply the slight possibility that even a fully recovered patient might still be a silent carrier of the virus. In this scenario, however, no family members were reported to be infected, since all of the four patients with bizarrely late positive tests were medical professional, and followed all of the guidelines while they were at home quarantine. With due attention to this incident, the current criteria for hospital discharge may need to be reconsidered (Lan et al.,
2020
).

9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

Deemed a global health emergency, COVID-19 outbreak has continued to be the headline of the news. The number of confirmed cases is on the rise, and the seamless spread of the virus has become a plight for general population, and the entire medical community. In spite of the extreme preventive measures while near a patient, clinicians are still at great risk for contracting the disease from the visitors. Else, it is vividly known that quarantine alone is not the optimal choice for containing of the virus. On the other hand, the devastating potential impact of the outbreak is a much feared topic around the world. Science has always been the ultimate arsenal of weaponry when it comes to battling obstinate pathogens; however, time is needed for conduction of proper investigations on human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

With no access to requisite information on the structure and life cycle of the novel Coronavirus, research and development programs on therapeutic agents become a far-fetched milestone, rendering the tried-and-true primary prevention measures the only proper means to confront SARS-CoV-2. As of today, few existing drugs have been considered for treatment of COVID-19, with scant reports on benevolence of the results. As our meager knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing, one may speculate the advent of an effectual vaccine, alongside treatment options that might include antiviral agents, and even monoclonal antibodies. At the time of writing this manuscript, no definitive treatment option has been known for COVID-19; however, the unabating flow of investigations and clinical trials may soon lead us to the optimal therapy for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.

Needless to say, the fascinatingly high transmissibility of COVID-19 demands meticulous monitoring of the transmission routes and patterns to a reach a firm theory on adaptive mechanisms wielded by SARs-CoV-2, thus, making an accurate prediction about the future outcomes regarding pathogenicity, transmissibility, and evolution of the virus. These efforts will hopefully result in better prognosis and fewer mortalities.

Abstract

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic of 2019-2020 has resulted in multiple hospitalizations, deaths and economic hardships worldwide. Though respiratory involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is well-known, the potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations are less-understood. We performed a PubMed and Google Scholar search and reviewed relevant literature regarding COVID-19 and cardiovascular system involvement. SARS-CoV-2 possesses high-affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly concentrated in the lungs and cardiovascular tissue, thereby provoking concern for cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 cases. Pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease has been shown in previous reports to be a risk-factor for severe infection. Based on our review of published studies, COVID-19 patients may be more likely to experience acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, coagulation defects and acute stroke and are likely to have poorer outcomes as a result. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more data regarding potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease is required.

Abstract

For those who work in the field of islet transplantation, the micro vascular COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thrombo-inflammatory syndrome (recently referred to as MicroCLOTS) is familiar, as one cannot fail to recognize the presence of similarities with the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) occurring in the liver hours and days after islet infusion. Evidences in both MicroCLOTS and IBMIR suggest the involvement of the coagulation cascade and complement system activation, and proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines release. Identification and targeting of pathway(s) playing a role as ""master regulator(s)"" in the post-islet transplant detrimental inflammatory events could be potentially useful to suggest innovative COVID-19 treatments and vice versa. All the scientific organizations across the world are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Islet transplantation, and more generally the transplantation scientific community, could contribute suggesting strategies for innovative approaches. At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation, and complement/microthrombosis activation. These data will represent a legacy to be transformed into innovation in the transplant field. It will be our contribution to change a dramatic event into advancement for the transplant field, and ultimately for our patients.

Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a complex multisystem and coagulopathic disease that emerged in late 2019 and is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has since led to a global pandemic. COVID-19 is a disease the likes of which has not been seen before. It bears some similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but due to the global nature of the disease and the numbers of people affected by it, it has allowed medical researchers all around the world to begin to undertake a more comprehensive analysis of the disease. COVID-19 needs to be recognised as multisystem disease with associated derangement of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing cell loss, a subsequent relative angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 deficiency with imbalance towards ACE, and abnormal coagulation. This paper aims to examine this pathophysiology in more detail and how this will affect the role of hospital care and the role of general practitioners in the fight against this disease. It aims to challenge our clinical reasoning based upon the emerging pathophysiology of the disease and to encourage clinicians to continuously update their management of the disease based upon the evolving understanding of it.

COVID-19: towards understanding of pathogenesis

Subjects

Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has caused considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide, and become a priority of the global society. Better understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 will provide important insight into its management.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly. Although the cause was quickly identified as a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, our knowledge of this novel virus remains very limited. High infectivity of the virus, lack of effective antivirals and vaccines, and potentially large asymptomatic populations, have made management of COVID-19 extremely challenging. In addition to rapid medical responses, continuous efforts to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease will undoubtedly enlighten the optimal management of the growing pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the b-coronavirus family, and is partially related with the known SARS-CoV (~79% similarity) and MERS-CoV (~50% similarity) according to genome sequencing.
1
Same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its main receptor, which is broadly expressed in vascular endothelium, respiratory epithelium, alveolar monocytes, and macrophages.
1
The main transmission route is through direct or indirect respiratory tract exposure. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of active replication in the upper respiratory tissues,
1
,
2
as demonstrated by successful live virus isolation from throat swabs and detection of viral subgenomic messenger RNA (sgRNA) in cells of upper respiratory tract.
2
Tropism of the upper respiratory tissue probably explains continuous pharyngeal shedding of the virus and a more efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV when symptoms are still minimal and restricted to the upper respiratory tract. Later in the disease course, COVID-19 resembles SARS in terms of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, and generates secondary viremia, followed by extensive attack against target organs that express ACE2, such as heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and vast distal vasculature. This process of viral spreading correlates with the clinical deterioration, mainly taking place around the second week following disease onset. However, it has been generally recognized that disease exaggeration till the late stage is not only attributed to direct viral damage, but also a consequence of immune-mediated injury induced by SARS-CoV-2. Of note, two distinctive features have been noticed in severe and critical patients with COVID-19, progressive increase of inflammation and an unusual trend of hypercoagulation.

Although the concept of inflammatory storm remains controversial, there is no doubt that immune-mediated inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, just as it did in SARS. The progression of COVID-19 was associated with a continuous decrease in lymphocyte count and significant elevation of neutrophils. Meanwhile, inflammatory markers were markedly elevated including C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-6, IP-10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFa. Reduced lymphocyte count and elevated levels of ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer were reported in various studies to be associated with increased mortality of COVID-19.
3
,
4
Mechanisms underlying the progressive lymphopenia in severe and critical COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Subset analysis showed a general decrease in B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, which was more prominent in severe cases.
3
Xu et al.
5
reported increased level of CD8
+
T-cell activation (measured by proportions of CD38 and HLA-DR expression) despite the reduction in CD8
+
T-cell count in one critically ill COVID-19 patient. Lymphopenia was also an important feature of SARS patients, and decline of both CD4
+
and CD8
+
T lymphocytes often preceded the radiographic changes.
6
Although direct infection of macrophages and lymphocytes by SARS-CoV was indicated by one study,
7
rapid reduction of lymphocyte counts in SARS was further attributed to two mechanisms, redistribution of the circulating lymphocytes or depletion of lymphocytes through apoptosis or pyroptosis.
6
,
8

Currently, no viral gene expression has been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with COVID-19.
9
However, Wang et al.
10
indicated that T lymphocytes may be more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 than to SARS-CoV, possibly through an endocytosis pathway triggered by the spike protein. As ACE2 is not readily expressed on lymphocytes, the efficiency of membrane fusion and to what extent this may account for the overall loss of lymphocytes remain to be elucidated. Moreover, Xiong et al.
9
reported upregulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and p53 pathways in PBMCs of COVID-19 patients. Zheng et al.
11
suggested functional exhaustion of NK and CD8
+
T cells with increased expression of NKG2A in COVID-19 patients, which could be restored after recovery. These findings indicated that immune disturbance starts early in COVID-19, as a combined result of both direct and bystander effects. Although current observations revealed that these changes might be largely reversible, especially in mild or moderate cases, long-term follow-up is warranted for further evaluation of the immune function in recovered patients.

We and others have noticed an exceptionally high proportion of aberrant coagulation in severe and critical patients with COVID-19. This was rare for other coronavirus infections, but has been reported in severe influenza. COVID-19 patients exhibited a hypercoagulable state, featured by prolonged prothrombin time, elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, and near normal activated partial thromboplastin time. A few patients would finally progress to overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Tang et al.
12
reported that 71.4% of non-survivors and 0.6% of survivors of COVID-19 showed evidence of overt DIC. Indeed, more patients exhibited latent DIC characterized by a hypercoagulable state, as demonstrated by fibrin thrombus formation in post-mortem examination. A high proportion of acro-ischemia was also observed in deteriorating patients with COVID-19, indicating a hypercoagulable status before the final onset of overt DIC.

Several factors may contribute to the coagulation disorder in COVID-19 patients. The persistent inflammatory status in severe and critical COVID-19 patients acts as an important trigger for the coagulation cascade. Certain cytokines including IL-6 could activate the coagulation system and suppress the fibrinolytic system. In the setting of COVID-19, pulmonary and peripheral endothelial injury due to direct viral attack might be an equally important inducer of hypercoagulation. Endothelial cell injury can strongly activate the coagulation system via exposure of tissue factor and other pathways. Moreover, aggressive immune response could also be augmented by dysfunctional coagulation. These two processes may act in a feed-forward manner towards an uncontrolled endpoint. In addition, the emergence of antiphospholipid antibodies may intensify the coagulopathy. Various levels of anti-cardiolipin and anti-b2GP1 antibodies were detected in our COVID-19 patients, and additional management strategies may be needed.
13

Based on what we have learned, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be divided into three phases: viremia phase, acute phase (pneumonia phase) and severe or recovery phase (Fig.
1
).
14
Patients with competent immune functions and without obvious risk factors (old age, co-morbidities, etc.) may generate effective and adequate immune responses to suppress the virus in the first or second phase without immune over-reaction. In contrast, patients with immune dysfunction may have a higher risk of failing the initial phase and becoming the severe or critical type with higher mortality. Therefore, treatment of COVID-19 should be based on the staging of patients, and the window of opportunity may lie between the first and the second phases, when clinical deterioration is observed with evidence of abrupt inflammation and hypercoagulable status. With no proved antivirals, early intervention has mainly focused on the correct timing of disease stages and implementing ways to stop or slow disease progression. Once the patients enter the critical status, no magic bullet could be relied on other than comprehensive management.

Fig. 1: Hypothetical pathogenesis of COVID-19.

The X-axis refers to days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The disease course is divided into three phases. The Y-axis shows the trend of T cells, B cells, inflammatory factors, D-dimer and viral load in patients.
a
The trend of each indicator in severe COVID-19 patients.
b
The trend of each indicator in severe COVID-19 patients after low-molecular-weight heparin (LWMH) and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. The shaded areas represent the recommended intervention time for LMWH and IVIg treatment.

There has been no consensus regarding the best management options during patient deterioration. Potential measures include glucocorticoids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab, etc.), convalescent plasma therapy and other immunomodulators. In our center, given the benefits and risks of each option, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin treatment at 0.3-0.5 g per kg weight per day for five days was recommended to interrupt the inflammatory flare at an early stage.
15
Meanwhile, we recommend early anticoagulation therapy, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) when D-dimer level is 4 times higher than the upper limit of normal range, unless there is contraindication (Fig.
1b
).
14
Overview of these therapeutic approaches will be discussed by Dr Wenhong Zhang and colleagues in this issue. A take-home message here is that timing is extremely important in this group of patients, regardless of what treatment might be used.

Although management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients is important in reducing the mortality of the ongoing pandemic, the truly key measures lie in prevention, monitoring and timely intervention. To be fully prepared for this ongoing pandemic and any outbreak that might occur in the future, it is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. We anticipate more studies to facilitate the development of specific therapeutics to control the virus, minimize pulmonary injuries or optimize immune responses."

Background: COVID-19 induces progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, mostly due to a dysregulated inflammatory response. Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function.
Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study.
Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g/L, p<0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p<0.0001] and death rate (52.4% vs 21.7%, p<0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex.
Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.

COVID-19: the Italian Drama

Four avoidable risk factors

In December 2019, a new potentially pandemic Coronavirus made its appearance in the province of Wuhan, China. From there, the epidemic began to spread to the rest of China, then to Asia and all over the world. Today, cases are reported in over one hundred countries, in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Oceania. The feared transmission of the virus from human to human has been confirmed in all these regions and in Europe, also by asymptomatic subjects. It is difficult to understand why these data have long been underestimated, above all in the West Countries. Only on March 11
th
2020 the WHO declared the pandemic alarm. To date, April 13
th
2020, the confirmed cases in the world are 1.844.863 and the confirmed deaths 117.021 (20.465 in Italy vs. 3.351 recorded in China and 222 in South Korea). The situation appears particularly serious in Northern Italy, and more recently also in UK (11,329 deaths), France (14,946 deaths), Spain (17,489 deaths) and above all United States of America (21,972 deaths), with the number of cases doubling every day in Madrid and New York city. Italy has currently recorded 16.400 infected healthcare workers and 116 medical doctors dead. In this paper, we will try to explain why Italy has become the second epicenter of the world epidemics after China, and why the containment strategies and preventive measures adopted so far by the Italian government still do not seem to be sufficiently adequate in slowing the expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Introduction: Chronicles of a drama foretold

One of the most false claims that have circulated in these 40 dramatic days in Italy is that the drama we are experiencing was not foreseeable and preventable. This is not true. First of all, because for at least twenty years, from the first alarms on the avian flu and then on the SARS Coronavirus, we knew that the chances of a pandemic were high. Secondly, because those who had dealt with these problems in those years had tried in every way to warn the establishment of the impending danger, especially seeing how the Asian countries were reacting. It is true that only a few experts had been able to realize the danger of the virus very early, having the Chinese sequenced it in a record time and published the sequence on January 12th. But it is equally undeniable that the media from all over the world were full of images of what was going on in China. And it was evident that the announced drama was taking place, but also that China, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and all Southeast Asia countries were well prepared and were reacting quickly and effectively. It is certainly possible to assert that the Chinese could have warned us earlier, given that at the end of December they knew what was going on. But, in all sincerity we have to admit that, seeing what happened in Italy and in other western countries, things would not have changed much. Because the inhabitants of the wealthy West did not believe that a pandemic in the 21
st
century would be a drama like that we are experiencing. Ordinary citizens did not believe it, politicians and intellectuals did not believe it, nor did many of the experts who should have organized the strategies in time to slow down the inexorable advance of the virus. Many of whom not only lacked specific expertise and experience, but as a well-known parasitologist from the University of Padua declared, they followed the pandemic on television. Instead of organizing in time: the information and training of citizens and health workers; the radical reorganization of the health system, in order to obtain the early recognition of patients; the active surveillance and local monitoring; the creation of alternative corridors for diagnosis and isolation of patients and their contacts; the strengthening of the hospital wards necessary to treat serious cases; the protection of healthcare professionals. If it is beyond doubt that Western countries did not react correctly, it is equally interesting to analyze their different reactions arising from their history and culture and the consequences of these. The countries of southern Europe, mainly Italy, have long underestimated the risks and risked to have their health systems overwhelmed, in the most affected regions. The northern European countries reacted in a more orderly and rational manner and were able to reduce the damage and the deaths. The Anglo-Saxon countries have perhaps more than all the other underestimated the virus, especially in the first phases of the pandemic, thinking in a very Darwinian way that it would have been better to take into account thousands of deaths among the weakest and oldest, rather than slowing down and hurting economy. Yet, the way the pandemic is spreading and its dramatic initial effects demonstrate the weakness of all these analyzes. Reflecting on some of the dramatic misunderstandings made in Italy, which had the misfortune of being the first western country hit hard by the pandemic, can be of great help for the future.

Some articles have already highlighted several significant aspects of the Italian outbreak. At this point, we should investigate why Italy has become the second epicenter of the world epidemic, wondering whether the extreme social restrictions and measures adopted so far by the Italian government will sufficiently slow the expansion of the epidemic. In an attempt to address this question, we may compare what happened in China, the country that first had to face the new pandemic and that efficiently managed to quickly curb its expansion, with what it is ongoing in Italy. The first observation that arises from our analysis is that, unlike their Chinese and Asian colleagues, - who had the opportunity to be alerted by the previous outbreaks caused by the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV/2003) - European and Italian experts, in particular, did not believe in time that SARS-CoV-2/2019 could be the pandemic virus expected for over 20 years.

It is useful to remember that when facing a possible pandemic event, due to a pathogen that has made the species jump, it is necessary to consider three main factors:

1) the pathogen;
2) the reaction of the host immune response to the pathogen;
3) environmental factors and related containment strategies.

In this report we describe the critical errors that were made in addressing these factors according to our analyses of the phenomenon.

The first factor: The pathogen

The pathogen, which is the cause of the first pandemic of the third millennium, is the acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as COVID-19, a single-stranded RNA virus, closely similar to another Coronavirus thought to originate from bats. Unlike previous pandemics, the sequencing of COVID-19 was accomplished in early 2020 very rapidly by Chinese researchers who had made it immediately available to the international scientific community. A few days later, the Pasteur Institute announced that it had also completed the sequencing from samples obtained from two patients (one in Paris the other in Bordeaux) suspected to be infected with this new Coronavirus. The two French patients completed sequences were filed on January 30 on the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) platform. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate (genetically almost identical to the Wuhan virus master sequence) was shared with national and international reference laboratories. The availability of these sequences, due to high-minded sharing of data by scientists, made possible not only the rapid identification of the new virus responsible for the several sporadic cases all around the world, but also, at least by induction, the immediate recognition of its contagiousness and virulence. The discovery could have provided a potentially huge advantage to face the global pandemic that was emerging. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Many eminent pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists continued to assert that the pathogen involved in the outbreak was a common Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) and that the potential risks triggered by unfounded panic would be even greater than those associated with the virus itself.

The first avoidable risk factor: Inadequate attention to the virus

In addressing this first error, it is important to stress that the first assessment of the magnitude of risks associated with a new virus can be achieved starting from the genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the virus itself. It does not take more than 48-72 hours to reconstruct the phylogenetic rank of a virus starting from the sequences of the isolated strains. At this point, we must admit that in Italy sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes on the isolated strains have not been sufficiently timely or accurate. In particular, 15 days were lost to search for the supposed Italian zero patient, instead of trying to understand, on the basis of the genetic sequences, from where the virus had arrived and how it was spreading throughout northern Italy. In early February, the sequencing of the new virus was announced by the National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome. In early March, the phylogenetic analysis of the first 3 genomes obtained from the Italian SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Lombardy and sequenced at the Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, demonstrated both the Chinese origin of the pandemic outbreak and their derivation from a cluster of genomes isolated in other European countries (in particular in Germany and Finland) and in Central-South America. The virologists who glanced at the viral RNA stunned. It was really a virus that had 96% of the genome of a bat-coronavirus, but also 8 mutations at the key points: the sequences coding for the spike protein, which would have made the virus terribly contagious and invasive for the human species.

The second avoidable risk factor: The delay of the pandemic alarm

It was therefore truly a pandemic virus, and not a normal parainfluenza virus, as unfortunately many expert infectious disease specialists, had repeatedly affirmed. This interpretation was the fundamental error that prompted politicians, health workers and ordinary people to underestimate the alarm for a long time, to waste precious time, to expose themselves without sufficient protection and to promote, first in Italy and then in Europe, the current almost uncontrollable spread of the virus. On the other hand, the scientific community and politicians waited to act that the WHO decided to declare the pandemic alarm, which this time arrived too late. How can we motivate this delay? It is useful to remember that in recent decades, some large avian outbreaks and repeated and widespread human clusters, mainly in China and Southeast Asia, led the WHO to launch some alerts for a possible ""avian"" pandemic, inappropriately criticized by many, owing to ideological and political, rather than scientific motivations. Furthermore, it is important to underline the detrimental role played by the social media, where innumerable
fake news
circulated, generally connected to conspiracy-type assumptions. It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that these criticisms negatively influenced WHO, when the feared pandemic actually occurred.

The second factor: The reaction of the new guest

The capacity to invade the host and to spread in organs and tissues, the contagiousness and ultimately the ability to transmit from human to human are determined by the genetic and molecular structure of a new virus. SARS-CoV-2/2019 acquired these properties in a very short time and the underestimation of these findings by many experts was one of the main reasons for the rapid expansion of the epidemic outbreak, particularly in Italy. Yet, some aspects of the host immune response and its diverse reaction modes need clarification. It is useful to recall that most viruses do not cause serious or even lethal systemic diseases. In the most serious and severe viral infections, it is the contribution of the host's immune response that plays the most important determinative role. Paradoxically, it is an excessive immunological reaction or a dysregulated aberration of natural immunity with hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that results in the organ damage in the most serious viral infections, a phenomenon referred to as
cytokine storm
. In the great pandemics of the past and in recent outbreaks, the high lethality rates even among young subjects, were probably due to this mechanism, although in some, e.g., the Spanish flu, bacterial infection could have played a significant role. Both the data from China and from the most serious cases of the Italian outbreak seem in line with this proposed pathogenesis. The most typical and serious prototypic presentation seems to be Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with exceptionally rapid evolution towards pulmonary fibrosis and a hypercoagulable state inducing pulmonary and systemic microvascular thrombosis that may play a major role in the progression of the disease towards death. Another troubling possibility, which should not be overlooked, is that many of the subjects who recover from the ARDS will also have the sequelae of reduced respiratory function throughout their lives.

A recent report from
the Lancet
supported this proposed pathogenic mechanisms, and advocated that treatment of
hyper-inflammation
using existing, approved ant-inflammatory cytokine therapies of proven safety may be critical in addressing the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the application of heparin has been recommended to avoid the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. It is also important to note, that the topic of high mortality in elderly subjects, carriers of serious chronic pathological diseases should not be used lightly, in support of the thesis that SARS-CoV-2/2019 would not be very different from the common flu and paraflu viruses. The difference also in this case is important: seasonal flu viruses act as a final cause in people with poor health, but they are not particularly dangerous for people living with them and for healthy and young people. On the contrary, pandemic viruses can cause serious and sometimes lethal pathological states even in healthy subjects and at a relatively young age. In this sense, even a hint to targeted molecular therapies can be illuminating. The drug that seems to have given the most promising results so far is
Tocillizumab
, a specific monoclonal antibody capable of blocking interleukin IL-6, interrupting or at least reducing the violence of the cytokine storm. Its effectiveness demonstrates that this one is the most important pathogenic mechanism in severe cases, proving, once again, that SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic virus and not a trivial parainfluenza virus. It is, therefore, only partially true that the factor that determined the extreme gravity of the current situation in Italy, compared to what happens during the annual flu epidemics, is only the extreme rapidity of the spread of the virus, which caused the assault on intensive care units. This type of analysis would lead once again to underestimate the true nature of SARS-CoV-2/2019 as a pandemic virus, and this would be a very serious mistake, which could have dramatic repercussions both on health workers and on the health system itself, not only in the short term, but also and above all in the medium to long term.

The third factor in play: Environmental features and containment strategies

The third fundamental factor is the environment in which the virus emerges and spreads. This is not the place to deal with the immense problem of altered ecosystems and microbial systems, the precarious socio-economic and town planning conditions in some countries, the critical conditions of fast-food chains, the undoubtedly underestimated role of pollution: all factors playing an important role, above all in the genesis and the initial spread of a pandemic. Only with regard to pollution we must mention that at least in this initial phase of the epidemic in Italy the areas characterized by the highest lethality rates are among the most polluted of the country. It has long been known that atmospheric particulate matter is an effective vector for the transport of viruses and for the spread of viral infections. During the avian flu outbreaks it was even shown that the particulates had carried the fearsome H5N1 for long distances and that there was an exponential correlation between the quantities of cases of infection and the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5. Not only a correlation between the presence of viruses in the particulate matter and epidemic outbreaks has never been proved, but it is increasingly evident that most of the infections occur by human contact and in closed and crowded environments (families, public places and unfortunately hospitals and healthcare residences). Any minimal quantities of viruses transported by the particulates do not seem to play a significant role in this context. Rather, it is the persistent air pollution rate that must be called into question and its effects on human health. Because of pollution, adults and in particular the elderly suffering from chronic diseases are affected by low grade persistent inflammation and systemic endothelial dysfunction, that appears to be the most potent predisposing and triggering factors for cytokine storm and thrombotic dysfunction. That's why it is conceivable that prolonged exposure to ultrafine particulates, heavy metals and other atmospheric pollutants played a pro-inflammatory role in subjects leaving in the Po Valley, one of the most polluted regions in Europe. In fact, in the scientific literature the role of air pollution in chronic diseases (in particular neurodegenerative, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases) has been demonstrated, and is very underestimated by official medicine. Furthermore, an ecological study has already documented a positive association between air pollution and mortality in the Chinese population during the SARS epidemic in 2003. To further verify these interesting correlations, however, it will be necessary to carefully evaluate the morbidity and lethality rates that will be recorded in the most polluted megacities of the world (New Delhi, Mexico City, Cairo), if they will be involved in the pandemic. An extremely controversial issue (certainly not to be overlooked) is that concerning the persistence of the virus in the environment and on certain materials rather than on others, evaluated, in some cases, even in many days. In any case, the personal and environmental hygiene rules have been largely and persistently reminded in these days. On the other hand, these are difficult data to interpret: above all, what is the ""bioavailability"" of viruses scattered on a sink or on the floor and in public places? In a recent study on influenza transmission, it has been shown that cough is not necessary for the emission of viruses and that nevertheless the exhaled infected aerosols essentially come from the lower respiratory tract. As already mentioned, the Chinese data in this case are very clear: the largely prevalent route of infection remains the traditional, direct, massive and prolonged one, via aerosols of respiratory droplets in closed rooms and in families.

Another aspect to be considered are the effects of the containment strategies put in place by China to stop the spread of the virus in the bud. Already from a summary analysis of the graphs, it is clear that in the first month, from early December until early January, COVID cases in China were very few. The increase began on January 21 (1500 cases in one day). Within 48 hours, the entire province of Hubei was closed: a decision not to be underestimated, considering that the region has almost the same number of inhabitants of Italy and France: about 60 million (on an area that is just over half of the Italian one and a third of France). The following day, January 23, another 15 cities were closed and as many the day after. Nevertheless, inevitably, the situation remained critical for two weeks, the whole country was placed under close surveillance and no further clusters were registered in the other regions. The increase in cases peaked around January 23-25 with 3000/3500 positive cases per day. The peak was followed by a short plateau of a few days and by a gradual reduction in cases which led to a very limited number in less than a month (300/day compared to over 3000/day at the peak moment). But how was all this achieved? Undoubtedly, the strength of the Chinese strategy was the overwhelming control of all the exposed population. For this purpose, a capillary monitoring system was organized through teams coordinated by experts, who interviewed all infected and positive people, and performed swabs not only on symptomatic subjects, but on all their contacts.

The Golden Rule: Pandemics must be stopped on the ground, not in hospitals

Only in this way was it possible to proceed not only with the immediate recognition and isolation of cases, but also with the quarantine of all close contacts. Strategies that worked thanks to a very high degree of acceptance and active collaboration by the population, much more informed and aware than in Western countries about the danger of such situations and the urgency and necessity of restrictions and containment strategies. The Chinese epidemiological data immediately confirmed the great effectiveness of such radical strategies: most of the cases and deaths had in fact occurred in the Hubei region alone, immediately put into quarantine (Fig. 1).

As for lethality rates, these too had been 4.5% in the Hubei region alone and less than 1% in the rest of the country, where the number of cases had remained very low. The early information concerning the immediate results obtained in China by closing entire regions and cities as soon as the first cases had arisen, should have shown the need to act immediately and radically, without waiting for the first clusters to manifest with dramatic evidence. Moreover, as early as mid-January, a considerable volume of news and images arrived in Europe showing thousands of disciplined Chinese walking, wearing their masks in the urban areas where the first cases had been detected, not to protect themselves, but mainly (despite being asymptomatic status) to avoid spreading the virus to others. Above all, it was immediately clear that only after the January 20 decision to set up places for the isolation of all the positives in ad hoc adapted buildings (i.e., gyms, barracks, exhibitions, etc.) did the first signs of epidemic appeared to slow down. The recognition of direct human to human spread of infection should have promptly led to the immediate closure of clubs and meeting places where the virus was likely to remain viable for a long periods and be easily transmitted, rather than the almost-prohibition of walking in the parks or in nature. Yet, above all, the absolutely fundamental data, which emerged from the WHO study, but already partially known through the international media, was that the Chinese immediately understood the necessity of adapting health facilities to the emergency. This included converting departments, increasing bed places, recruiting staff, building new healthcare facilities in record time, producing up to 1,500,000 tampons per week and above all, protecting medical and paramedical staff with adequate protective measures. Only in this way, would it be possible to prevent health facilities from becoming sites of the most dangerous and contagious places posing a clear and present danger for both health care personnel and for the whole country. In the meantime, many other Asian countries, in which the infection began to spread, reacted in an equally rapid and effective way. In particular, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong took timely and drastic measures, obtaining the rapid containment of the epidemic quickly and with a negligible increase in cases. The most probable explanation for this, is that all these countries were perfectly aware of the enormous risks associated with the spread of a pandemic virus, for at least two reasons: because of decades of experience in the prevention of the numerous potentially pandemic outbreaks originating in Southeast Asia; owing to the recent, dramatic experience of SARS faced in 2003 and subsequently studied with extreme attention, in order to avoid possible new outbreaks.

Unfortunately, the same scenario did not occur in western countries and, in particular, in Italy.

The Italian drama

As for the Italian situation on April 17
th
, the data appear to be critically extensive. In the first 50 days of the epidemic, 172.434 cases (22,745 dead) were identified mostly (> 80%) located in the 4 major northern regions: Lombardy (64.135/11.851 dead), Emilia-Romagna (21,834/2,903), Piedmont (19,803/2,171), Veneto (15,374/1,026). These figures are beyond those normally considered worrisome. The trend of deaths since February 25 followed a strictly exponential trajectory. Although it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions for mortality rates from the current epidemiological data in this first phase of the epidemic lethality rates (calculated on the basis of cases identified by PCR tests) appear very high, although with considerable variability from region to region. The most dramatic scenario occurred in Lombardy, one of the richest regions characterized by a high-level health organization. Nonetheless, 10,627 currently hospitalized patients, probably many more real deaths than the almost 12,000 officially registered (with a lethality rate close to 20%) and still 971 cases in intensive care units (ICU) have been already recorded in Lombardy. Much more dramatic data than those officially reported in China, where the lethality rates quickly plateaued at 3.5%. Not much better are the data from Emilia-Romagna where the lethality rates are slightly lower than 15% and Piedmont where the lethality rates are approximately 10% (in any case 3 times greater than in China). Slightly better are the lethality rates (around 6-7%) in the Veneto region, the only region of Northern Italy that immediately underwent strict containment measures, in open contrast to official government rules, significantly slowing down the spread of the virus. Evidently, these are really dramatic data: 20/30 times higher than those due to the common seasonal influence. To which it is necessary to add the number of ICU admissions, many of which have ARD, and are doomed to death. Undisputed data are that throughout Italy over 10-15% of those affected so far have died or been hospitalized in intensive care.

A situation that seems to have no precedent except, perhaps, in the Spanish Flu. In that case, however, the retrospective computation of lethality data was very difficult. Recently, an agreement has been reached on these figures: approximately 50 million deaths and 500 million infected in 1.8-2 billion people. Which would mean lethality rates oscillating between 2 and 10%, but mortality rate around 2.5%. Moreover, we should consider that a century ago developing a
cytokines storm
and an ARD generally meant death. So, it is not unexpected that young people frequently died, especially in the second epidemic wave, which was much more lethal than the first: a most worrisome possibility for the current COVID-19 pandemic. As for Asiatic flu (1957), the lethality cases seem to have been much lower: probably around 0.5-1% and even lower those of Hong Kong flu (1968), despite the lack of current therapeutic possibilities. Yet, it is evident that something does not work in such evaluations. And above all, how can we explain the dramatic situation in Northern Italy with very high lethal rates and thousands of ICU patients and the much less severe one in central and southern Italy?

The third avoidable risk factor: The partial and late application of the Chinese and Asian strategies

Many have so far interpreted the aforementioned data as the classic tip of the iceberg, in relation to a probable wide circulation of the new virus in the general population and a very large number of asymptomatic subjects. It is in fact probable that, if the evaluations previously described are true and the virus has been circulating, at least in the northern regions, for almost 2 months, the subjects infected and capable of infecting others could already be hundreds of thousands in Italy. In this case, the very high lethal rates that are creating panic would be an almost artifact. Indeed, it is evident that screening only symptomatic subjects by PCR test and not ascertaining or monitoring their contacts, means selecting the most severely affected among the infected without considering all those subjects who have already encountered the virus and have overcome mild forms of the disease and are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic. It is at least partly for these reasons that on the one hand in Italy lethality rates are much higher than in China, on the other hand the virus continues to circulate and expand freely.

Anyway, among the many important data that emerged from the WHO study in China, one does not seem convincing: that in most cases, those who meet the virus sooner or later become symptomatic. The data that appear every day in Italy and in other countries contradict this theory: the majority of people infected with the virus remain asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic and appear to be the most dangerous source of spread of the epidemic. And in fact, recently, researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health established that undocumented infections probably facilitated the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan, especially before the restrictions. According to their study, published in
Science
, 86% of all infections had not been recognized and these subjects, although presumably less infectious compared to the symptomatic ones, would have been the source of 2/3 of all infections. If these assessments are truthful, in Italy another fundamental mistake was to focus exclusively on serious cases, while in China it was immediately understood that it was necessary to test and monitor all cases and in particular the mild ones (anyone who had symptoms of fever, asthenia and cough) and anyone who had direct contact, especially if protracted, with them. It should be clear that if we only focus on serious cases, characterized by high and prolonged fever, asthenia, cardiovascular symptoms, high pressure, neurological and respiratory disorders, which according to Chinese data should be only 5% of the total, an early diagnosis will not be possible. And, above all, the dissemination of the virus, essentially occurring through the infected patients who are still asymptomatic, will not stop. Relying on these criteria, reserving testing to serious cases was a serious mistake, which the Asian countries did not make.

A drama in the drama, in Italy, concerns health professionals: according to the data released by the ISS, in Italy since the beginning of the epidemic, at least 17,000 health professionals have contracted the COVID infection (equal to 10% of the total number of people infected!) and 130 medical doctors deceased. These data are enormously worse than those of the Chinese cohort (3300 infected, 3.8% of the total number, and 23 deaths) reported in a study published in
JAMA
. It is increasingly evident that these events would have been largely avoidable if specific hospital/diagnostic paths had been set, and if health workers would have been properly informed and furnished with ""sufficient protective equipment"". A very serious fact not only on the moral and juridical level, but also for the consequences it will have. And this not only in Italy, but with increasingly dramatic evidence, in all Western countries.

Finally, what happened in China, but also in other Asian countries, demonstrates the importance of timely and correct information and the proactive and convinced participation of the population. The accurate and rapidly implemented surveillance also made it possible to make predictions on the evolution of the epidemic outbreak that proved to be accurate. After setting the starting point of the epidemic on December 8, the date of the first case diagnosed in Wuhan by the famous doctor Li, who unfairly censored unfortunately died, Chinese experts calculated that the peak would be reached in a few weeks; that the plateau would have been short, reaching around 85,000 total cases; that the outbreak would decrease and then shut down after about 100 days. At this point it will be difficult to predict what will happen in Italy and in the other western countries, where the restrictions have been implemented too late and gradually, without the accuracy of the Chinese and above all, as mentioned, only considering severe cases and significant clusters. As we can see (Fig. 2), the very
first divide
in epidemiological data concerns, on the one hand, Asian countries which, for the above-mentioned reasons, were able to cope drastically and effectively with the epidemic, on the other hand Western countries which having underestimated the pre-pandemic alarm and the virus itself were found unprepared.

Fig 2. The global divide: Asian versus Western Countries. The diffusion patterns of SARS-CoV-2 deaths number growth in different countries are outlined. Cumulative number of deceased is considered from the first day with 100 recognized cases. South Corea is taken as example of a country accustomed to dealing with this type of emergency and ""sensitized"" by SARS/2002 related pandemic warnings. Taken from
COVID Time Series Test
.

As for Italy, a similar epidemic gap is evident between the northern and southern regions. Indeed, the fact that the southern regions could benefit of a longer latency time between the first cases and the spread of the virus played an important role. We hypothesize that the fact of having been able to reduce the inflow of infected people in hospitals made the difference (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. The Italian divide. Cumulative growth of COVID cases number in three North Italian regions (Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia) and three South regions (Campania, Puglia, Sicilia) starting from the first case registered in Veneto. The six areas have a similar population size. The institution of the red zone was established 17-18 days after the tenth case in North Italy and 6-11 days after the tenth case in the South.

Unfortunately, as the days go by, it becomes more and more evident that many other western nations are destined to follow the fate of Italy. Starting from Spain, which in the last 20 days has gone from 39,670 cases/2696 deaths to 177,633 cases/18,579 deaths). Followed by France, which in the same period went from 22,025 cases/1100 deaths to 105,155 cases/17,146 deaths. And again: United Kingdom from 8081 cases/422 deaths to 98,480 cases/12,868 deaths. And finally, USA from 51,914 cases/673 deaths to 604,070 cases/25.871 deaths. And the rule becomes increasingly evident: a pandemic unfortunately accelerates inexorably, in countries that do not implement rapid and decisive containment strategies.

The fourth avoidable risk factor: Insufficient information and protection of the operators and the health system

The fourth error, which unfortunately is about to manifest itself in Italy and in all western countries all its dramatic relevance, derives directly from the first three and in particular from the underestimation of the pathogenic potential of a pandemic virus. It essentially consists of the insufficient information about the risks associated with a direct (and therefore massive) exposure to the new bug. Neither ordinary people, nor especially health workers, have been warned in time and adequately protected. Furthermore, our requests to quickly adapt to the emergency the National Health System and in particular hospital facilities were not taken into consideration.

In fact, because of the ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" (PHEIC) announced by the World Organization the New Coronavirus Emergency had already been announced, for six months, on 31 January, in The Official Journal of The Italian Republic, by a Decree of the Council of Ministers. Yet, the correct measures did not start even after the beginning of the outbreak. The golden standard for trying to stop a pandemic is to face it on the territory, safeguarding hospitals, as Asian countries have done (preparing for these emergencies for 30 years). We should have arranged alternative pathways to prevent the virus from entering hospitals through the emergency rooms: by organizing military hospitals and other alternative facilities for positive quarantine; by testing and monitoring interpersonal contacts; adequately protecting health professionals assigned to SARS CoV2 control; organizing hospital wards and in particular intensive care units only for COVID. Neglecting these basic rules, you risk turning hospitals into virus sanctuaries. After all, some article has indirectly recognized the possible role of hospitals in amplifying and perpetuating the epidemic. While the great part of health workers usually protect themselves from observable droplet transmissions, they are often unaware that asymptomatic transmit the virus even more often than symptomatic. Moreover, fomite transmission is frequently overlooked in hospitals. It has been proven that a very careful control of the correct management of the fomites plays an important role in the control of the pandemic. Unfortunately, western countries have shown not to be ready to face such events. Although the danger of a pandemic had been known for 20 years, a pandemic virus has been circulating in Europe for at least 2 months, without taking adequate precautions. Neither ordinary people, nor especially health workers, have been warned in time and adequately protected. Furthermore, our reiterated requests for to quickly adapt to the emergency the National Health System and in particular hospital facilities were not taken into consideration.

As regards the urgent and inevitably profound and articulated adaptation of the health system, a first reorganization proposed by us and uselessly solicited on several occasions, consists in the establishment of alternative corridors and dedicated medical areas that should be able to operate in coordinated succession:

A) in each region or province, a single extra-hospital center should be equipped primarily for initial triage, early diagnosis and immediate isolation of positive cases, characterized by mild symptoms (presumably about 80% of cases). Obviously, in this first center, the adequate protection of all the medical personnel assigned is already mandatory. It is extremely important to understand that this center will have to replace any other private and public structure with regard to the immediate approach to suspicious cases that must absolutely not go to private medical offices and hospital facilities. Equally important will be (as in Asian Countries) the research, the correct information and the monitoring of the contacts of all the positive subjects;

B) secondly, wards and hospital or extra-hospital structures should be organized, capable of administering supportive care to cases of medium severity (probably about 15%) needing, in particular, protracted (3/6 weeks), non-invasive oxygen therapy (NUV-Non Invasive Ventilation). Even in these cases, particularly accurate and protracted monitoring will be essential, because the sudden evolution of some towards more serious and acute forms does not seem rare;

C) In this way, only 5% of cases should reach the intensive care units (ICU), requiring intubation and assisted ventilation. In a situation such as the current one, it will be necessary not only to urgently strengthen the current intensive care units, but also to transform some wards normally used for long-term hospitalization, into wards adequate to cope with the emergency.

Lessons to be learnt

We started writing this article a month ago, in the belief that a correct analysis and evaluation of the mistakes made in Italy, the first western country hit by the pandemic, could have prevented the drama from spreading quickly to other countries. But in the 21
st
century pandemics spread through highways, super-fast trains and international flights and there is not enough time to imitate effective reactions (if you are not prepared in time), or to learn from the mistakes of others. At this point, the analysis of the mistakes made must be extended to all western countries if we do not want to risk being caught unprepared by a second wave of pandemic and in the face of other increasingly probable pandemic outbreaks.

In a nutshell, too many western experts underestimated the pandemic alarm and therefore the virus, which like all ""new viruses"" has recently gained both contagion/spreading modalities, and pathogenic mechanisms very different from the viruses known for some time to the human immune system. As a result, they did not look for suspicious cases from the beginning and when the first case was diagnosed it was already too late, since the virus was probably circulating in many countries at the end of December. However, it is clear that timely and effective choices would have been possible only if China had raised the alarm in time, rather than hiding the first cases. Nonetheless, we have to admit that western countries would still have found it difficult to react efficiently, due to the lack of experience and real experts in this area. In Italy, at least, this lack of experience has been very evident and harmful. Otherwise, would symptomatic cases be identified in time; the viral genomes of the ascertained cases sequenced; the phylogenetically probable path of the virus reconstructed, avoiding the wrong perception (unfortunately rapidly becoming international) of an almost indigenous, sudden and difficult to interpret ""Italian drama"". Especially since many experts, have continued to say that 2019nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was a common flu virus, which in most cases favored/accelerated the death of the elderly and debilitated subjects.

Based on these misunderstanding, many Italian experts (and consequently politicians) did not understand that it was necessary to immediately close, as in China, not only the areas of the first clusters, but entire regions, scrupulously checking the exposed population, monitoring and isolating the infected and their contacts, and above all preventing the circulation of the asymptomatic carriers of the virus. It is evident that the situation is critical today precisely in the areas of the first clusters and the first dissemination. In some cities of Lombardy, such as Bergamo and Brescia, the virus spread hurriedly, in the absence of any perception of the risk and even minimal precautions. This provoked the collapse of the system and the spread of panic, which probably facilitated, in turn, immuno-inflammatory reactions.

Yet, the main mistake that has produced the most painful consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy was the insufficient information and protection of health personnel and the failure to adapt the National Health System to an emergency that seems to be only at the beginning. It would be important, at this point, to take the correct precautions, to predict and adjust western sanitary services to the ""Worst possible scenario"", which with reference to modern pandemics is represented by the Spanish Flu of 1918-20, where the expansion of the pandemic progressed through sequentially more deadly steps. After a relatively massive beginning, partly explained and perhaps underestimated due to the concomitant First World War in the first months of 1918, the second, truly devastating wave reached at the end of summer and in less than a year resulted in the death of 40-100 million men, women and children. It is from here that we must start: faced with a situation that could last for months and reappear in an even more dramatic form at a later date, it would not be sufficient to maintain the current lockdown conditions for a long time, simply waiting for the epidemic to subside. It would be necessary to understand that containment measures can serve to slow down the spread of a pandemic, but must be integrated with a rapid and effective reorganization of the entire health system to address this and other future increasingly probable pandemic alarms. What China and other Far Eastern countries effectively accomplished has yet not happened neither in Italy nor in the rest of the Western world.

COVID-19: the Italian Drama

Four avoidable risk factors

In December 2019, a new potentially pandemic Coronavirus made its appearance in the province of Wuhan, China. From there, the epidemic began to spread to the rest of China, then to Asia and all over the world. Today, cases are reported in over one hundred countries, in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Oceania. The feared transmission of the virus from human to human has been confirmed in all these regions and in Europe, also by asymptomatic subjects. It is difficult to understand why these data have long been underestimated, above all in the West Countries. Only on March 11
th
2020 the WHO declared the pandemic alarm. To date, April 13
th
2020, the confirmed cases in the world are 1.844.863 and the confirmed deaths 117.021 (20.465 in Italy vs. 3.351 recorded in China and 222 in South Korea). The situation appears particularly serious in Northern Italy, and more recently also in UK (11,329 deaths), France (14,946 deaths), Spain (17,489 deaths) and above all United States of America (21,972 deaths), with the number of cases doubling every day in Madrid and New York city. Italy has currently recorded 16.400 infected healthcare workers and 116 medical doctors dead. In this paper, we will try to explain why Italy has become the second epicenter of the world epidemics after China, and why the containment strategies and preventive measures adopted so far by the Italian government still do not seem to be sufficiently adequate in slowing the expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Introduction: Chronicles of a drama foretold

One of the most false claims that have circulated in these 40 dramatic days in Italy is that the drama we are experiencing was not foreseeable and preventable. This is not true. First of all, because for at least twenty years, from the first alarms on the avian flu and then on the SARS Coronavirus, we knew that the chances of a pandemic were high. Secondly, because those who had dealt with these problems in those years had tried in every way to warn the establishment of the impending danger, especially seeing how the Asian countries were reacting. It is true that only a few experts had been able to realize the danger of the virus very early, having the Chinese sequenced it in a record time and published the sequence on January 12th. But it is equally undeniable that the media from all over the world were full of images of what was going on in China. And it was evident that the announced drama was taking place, but also that China, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and all Southeast Asia countries were well prepared and were reacting quickly and effectively. It is certainly possible to assert that the Chinese could have warned us earlier, given that at the end of December they knew what was going on. But, in all sincerity we have to admit that, seeing what happened in Italy and in other western countries, things would not have changed much. Because the inhabitants of the wealthy West did not believe that a pandemic in the 21
st
century would be a drama like that we are experiencing. Ordinary citizens did not believe it, politicians and intellectuals did not believe it, nor did many of the experts who should have organized the strategies in time to slow down the inexorable advance of the virus. Many of whom not only lacked specific expertise and experience, but as a well-known parasitologist from the University of Padua declared, they followed the pandemic on television. Instead of organizing in time: the information and training of citizens and health workers; the radical reorganization of the health system, in order to obtain the early recognition of patients; the active surveillance and local monitoring; the creation of alternative corridors for diagnosis and isolation of patients and their contacts; the strengthening of the hospital wards necessary to treat serious cases; the protection of healthcare professionals. If it is beyond doubt that Western countries did not react correctly, it is equally interesting to analyze their different reactions arising from their history and culture and the consequences of these. The countries of southern Europe, mainly Italy, have long underestimated the risks and risked to have their health systems overwhelmed, in the most affected regions. The northern European countries reacted in a more orderly and rational manner and were able to reduce the damage and the deaths. The Anglo-Saxon countries have perhaps more than all the other underestimated the virus, especially in the first phases of the pandemic, thinking in a very Darwinian way that it would have been better to take into account thousands of deaths among the weakest and oldest, rather than slowing down and hurting economy. Yet, the way the pandemic is spreading and its dramatic initial effects demonstrate the weakness of all these analyzes. Reflecting on some of the dramatic misunderstandings made in Italy, which had the misfortune of being the first western country hit hard by the pandemic, can be of great help for the future.

Some articles have already highlighted several significant aspects of the Italian outbreak. At this point, we should investigate why Italy has become the second epicenter of the world epidemic, wondering whether the extreme social restrictions and measures adopted so far by the Italian government will sufficiently slow the expansion of the epidemic. In an attempt to address this question, we may compare what happened in China, the country that first had to face the new pandemic and that efficiently managed to quickly curb its expansion, with what it is ongoing in Italy. The first observation that arises from our analysis is that, unlike their Chinese and Asian colleagues, - who had the opportunity to be alerted by the previous outbreaks caused by the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV/2003) - European and Italian experts, in particular, did not believe in time that SARS-CoV-2/2019 could be the pandemic virus expected for over 20 years.

It is useful to remember that when facing a possible pandemic event, due to a pathogen that has made the species jump, it is necessary to consider three main factors:

1) the pathogen;
2) the reaction of the host immune response to the pathogen;
3) environmental factors and related containment strategies.

In this report we describe the critical errors that were made in addressing these factors according to our analyses of the phenomenon.

The first factor: The pathogen

The pathogen, which is the cause of the first pandemic of the third millennium, is the acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as COVID-19, a single-stranded RNA virus, closely similar to another Coronavirus thought to originate from bats. Unlike previous pandemics, the sequencing of COVID-19 was accomplished in early 2020 very rapidly by Chinese researchers who had made it immediately available to the international scientific community. A few days later, the Pasteur Institute announced that it had also completed the sequencing from samples obtained from two patients (one in Paris the other in Bordeaux) suspected to be infected with this new Coronavirus. The two French patients completed sequences were filed on January 30 on the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) platform. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate (genetically almost identical to the Wuhan virus master sequence) was shared with national and international reference laboratories. The availability of these sequences, due to high-minded sharing of data by scientists, made possible not only the rapid identification of the new virus responsible for the several sporadic cases all around the world, but also, at least by induction, the immediate recognition of its contagiousness and virulence. The discovery could have provided a potentially huge advantage to face the global pandemic that was emerging. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Many eminent pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists continued to assert that the pathogen involved in the outbreak was a common Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) and that the potential risks triggered by unfounded panic would be even greater than those associated with the virus itself.

The first avoidable risk factor: Inadequate attention to the virus

In addressing this first error, it is important to stress that the first assessment of the magnitude of risks associated with a new virus can be achieved starting from the genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the virus itself. It does not take more than 48-72 hours to reconstruct the phylogenetic rank of a virus starting from the sequences of the isolated strains. At this point, we must admit that in Italy sequencing and phylogenetic analyzes on the isolated strains have not been sufficiently timely or accurate. In particular, 15 days were lost to search for the supposed Italian zero patient, instead of trying to understand, on the basis of the genetic sequences, from where the virus had arrived and how it was spreading throughout northern Italy. In early February, the sequencing of the new virus was announced by the National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome. In early March, the phylogenetic analysis of the first 3 genomes obtained from the Italian SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Lombardy and sequenced at the Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, demonstrated both the Chinese origin of the pandemic outbreak and their derivation from a cluster of genomes isolated in other European countries (in particular in Germany and Finland) and in Central-South America. The virologists who glanced at the viral RNA stunned. It was really a virus that had 96% of the genome of a bat-coronavirus, but also 8 mutations at the key points: the sequences coding for the spike protein, which would have made the virus terribly contagious and invasive for the human species.

The second avoidable risk factor: The delay of the pandemic alarm

It was therefore truly a pandemic virus, and not a normal parainfluenza virus, as unfortunately many expert infectious disease specialists, had repeatedly affirmed. This interpretation was the fundamental error that prompted politicians, health workers and ordinary people to underestimate the alarm for a long time, to waste precious time, to expose themselves without sufficient protection and to promote, first in Italy and then in Europe, the current almost uncontrollable spread of the virus. On the other hand, the scientific community and politicians waited to act that the WHO decided to declare the pandemic alarm, which this time arrived too late. How can we motivate this delay? It is useful to remember that in recent decades, some large avian outbreaks and repeated and widespread human clusters, mainly in China and Southeast Asia, led the WHO to launch some alerts for a possible ""avian"" pandemic, inappropriately criticized by many, owing to ideological and political, rather than scientific motivations. Furthermore, it is important to underline the detrimental role played by the social media, where innumerable
fake news
circulated, generally connected to conspiracy-type assumptions. It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that these criticisms negatively influenced WHO, when the feared pandemic actually occurred.

The second factor: The reaction of the new guest

The capacity to invade the host and to spread in organs and tissues, the contagiousness and ultimately the ability to transmit from human to human are determined by the genetic and molecular structure of a new virus. SARS-CoV-2/2019 acquired these properties in a very short time and the underestimation of these findings by many experts was one of the main reasons for the rapid expansion of the epidemic outbreak, particularly in Italy. Yet, some aspects of the host immune response and its diverse reaction modes need clarification. It is useful to recall that most viruses do not cause serious or even lethal systemic diseases. In the most serious and severe viral infections, it is the contribution of the host's immune response that plays the most important determinative role. Paradoxically, it is an excessive immunological reaction or a dysregulated aberration of natural immunity with hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that results in the organ damage in the most serious viral infections, a phenomenon referred to as
cytokine storm
. In the great pandemics of the past and in recent outbreaks, the high lethality rates even among young subjects, were probably due to this mechanism, although in some, e.g., the Spanish flu, bacterial infection could have played a significant role. Both the data from China and from the most serious cases of the Italian outbreak seem in line with this proposed pathogenesis. The most typical and serious prototypic presentation seems to be Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with exceptionally rapid evolution towards pulmonary fibrosis and a hypercoagulable state inducing pulmonary and systemic microvascular thrombosis that may play a major role in the progression of the disease towards death. Another troubling possibility, which should not be overlooked, is that many of the subjects who recover from the ARDS will also have the sequelae of reduced respiratory function throughout their lives.

A recent report from
the Lancet
supported this proposed pathogenic mechanisms, and advocated that treatment of
hyper-inflammation
using existing, approved ant-inflammatory cytokine therapies of proven safety may be critical in addressing the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the application of heparin has been recommended to avoid the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. It is also important to note, that the topic of high mortality in elderly subjects, carriers of serious chronic pathological diseases should not be used lightly, in support of the thesis that SARS-CoV-2/2019 would not be very different from the common flu and paraflu viruses. The difference also in this case is important: seasonal flu viruses act as a final cause in people with poor health, but they are not particularly dangerous for people living with them and for healthy and young people. On the contrary, pandemic viruses can cause serious and sometimes lethal pathological states even in healthy subjects and at a relatively young age. In this sense, even a hint to targeted molecular therapies can be illuminating. The drug that seems to have given the most promising results so far is
Tocillizumab
, a specific monoclonal antibody capable of blocking interleukin IL-6, interrupting or at least reducing the violence of the cytokine storm. Its effectiveness demonstrates that this one is the most important pathogenic mechanism in severe cases, proving, once again, that SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic virus and not a trivial parainfluenza virus. It is, therefore, only partially true that the factor that determined the extreme gravity of the current situation in Italy, compared to what happens during the annual flu epidemics, is only the extreme rapidity of the spread of the virus, which caused the assault on intensive care units. This type of analysis would lead once again to underestimate the true nature of SARS-CoV-2/2019 as a pandemic virus, and this would be a very serious mistake, which could have dramatic repercussions both on health workers and on the health system itself, not only in the short term, but also and above all in the medium to long term.

The third factor in play: Environmental features and containment strategies

The third fundamental factor is the environment in which the virus emerges and spreads. This is not the place to deal with the immense problem of altered ecosystems and microbial systems, the precarious socio-economic and town planning conditions in some countries, the critical conditions of fast-food chains, the undoubtedly underestimated role of pollution: all factors playing an important role, above all in the genesis and the initial spread of a pandemic. Only with regard to pollution we must mention that at least in this initial phase of the epidemic in Italy the areas characterized by the highest lethality rates are among the most polluted of the country. It has long been known that atmospheric particulate matter is an effective vector for the transport of viruses and for the spread of viral infections. During the avian flu outbreaks it was even shown that the particulates had carried the fearsome H5N1 for long distances and that there was an exponential correlation between the quantities of cases of infection and the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5. Not only a correlation between the presence of viruses in the particulate matter and epidemic outbreaks has never been proved, but it is increasingly evident that most of the infections occur by human contact and in closed and crowded environments (families, public places and unfortunately hospitals and healthcare residences). Any minimal quantities of viruses transported by the particulates do not seem to play a significant role in this context. Rather, it is the persistent air pollution rate that must be called into question and its effects on human health. Because of pollution, adults and in particular the elderly suffering from chronic diseases are affected by low grade persistent inflammation and systemic endothelial dysfunction, that appears to be the most potent predisposing and triggering factors for cytokine storm and thrombotic dysfunction. That's why it is conceivable that prolonged exposure to ultrafine particulates, heavy metals and other atmospheric pollutants played a pro-inflammatory role in subjects leaving in the Po Valley, one of the most polluted regions in Europe. In fact, in the scientific literature the role of air pollution in chronic diseases (in particular neurodegenerative, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases) has been demonstrated, and is very underestimated by official medicine. Furthermore, an ecological study has already documented a positive association between air pollution and mortality in the Chinese population during the SARS epidemic in 2003. To further verify these interesting correlations, however, it will be necessary to carefully evaluate the morbidity and lethality rates that will be recorded in the most polluted megacities of the world (New Delhi, Mexico City, Cairo), if they will be involved in the pandemic. An extremely controversial issue (certainly not to be overlooked) is that concerning the persistence of the virus in the environment and on certain materials rather than on others, evaluated, in some cases, even in many days. In any case, the personal and environmental hygiene rules have been largely and persistently reminded in these days. On the other hand, these are difficult data to interpret: above all, what is the ""bioavailability"" of viruses scattered on a sink or on the floor and in public places? In a recent study on influenza transmission, it has been shown that cough is not necessary for the emission of viruses and that nevertheless the exhaled infected aerosols essentially come from the lower respiratory tract. As already mentioned, the Chinese data in this case are very clear: the largely prevalent route of infection remains the traditional, direct, massive and prolonged one, via aerosols of respiratory droplets in closed rooms and in families.

Another aspect to be considered are the effects of the containment strategies put in place by China to stop the spread of the virus in the bud. Already from a summary analysis of the graphs, it is clear that in the first month, from early December until early January, COVID cases in China were very few. The increase began on January 21 (1500 cases in one day). Within 48 hours, the entire province of Hubei was closed: a decision not to be underestimated, considering that the region has almost the same number of inhabitants of Italy and France: about 60 million (on an area that is just over half of the Italian one and a third of France). The following day, January 23, another 15 cities were closed and as many the day after. Nevertheless, inevitably, the situation remained critical for two weeks, the whole country was placed under close surveillance and no further clusters were registered in the other regions. The increase in cases peaked around January 23-25 with 3000/3500 positive cases per day. The peak was followed by a short plateau of a few days and by a gradual reduction in cases which led to a very limited number in less than a month (300/day compared to over 3000/day at the peak moment). But how was all this achieved? Undoubtedly, the strength of the Chinese strategy was the overwhelming control of all the exposed population. For this purpose, a capillary monitoring system was organized through teams coordinated by experts, who interviewed all infected and positive people, and performed swabs not only on symptomatic subjects, but on all their contacts.

The Golden Rule: Pandemics must be stopped on the ground, not in hospitals

Only in this way was it possible to proceed not only with the immediate recognition and isolation of cases, but also with the quarantine of all close contacts. Strategies that worked thanks to a very high degree of acceptance and active collaboration by the population, much more informed and aware than in Western countries about the danger of such situations and the urgency and necessity of restrictions and containment strategies. The Chinese epidemiological data immediately confirmed the great effectiveness of such radical strategies: most of the cases and deaths had in fact occurred in the Hubei region alone, immediately put into quarantine (Fig. 1).

As for lethality rates, these too had been 4.5% in the Hubei region alone and less than 1% in the rest of the country, where the number of cases had remained very low. The early information concerning the immediate results obtained in China by closing entire regions and cities as soon as the first cases had arisen, should have shown the need to act immediately and radically, without waiting for the first clusters to manifest with dramatic evidence. Moreover, as early as mid-January, a considerable volume of news and images arrived in Europe showing thousands of disciplined Chinese walking, wearing their masks in the urban areas where the first cases had been detected, not to protect themselves, but mainly (despite being asymptomatic status) to avoid spreading the virus to others. Above all, it was immediately clear that only after the January 20 decision to set up places for the isolation of all the positives in ad hoc adapted buildings (i.e., gyms, barracks, exhibitions, etc.) did the first signs of epidemic appeared to slow down. The recognition of direct human to human spread of infection should have promptly led to the immediate closure of clubs and meeting places where the virus was likely to remain viable for a long periods and be easily transmitted, rather than the almost-prohibition of walking in the parks or in nature. Yet, above all, the absolutely fundamental data, which emerged from the WHO study, but already partially known through the international media, was that the Chinese immediately understood the necessity of adapting health facilities to the emergency. This included converting departments, increasing bed places, recruiting staff, building new healthcare facilities in record time, producing up to 1,500,000 tampons per week and above all, protecting medical and paramedical staff with adequate protective measures. Only in this way, would it be possible to prevent health facilities from becoming sites of the most dangerous and contagious places posing a clear and present danger for both health care personnel and for the whole country. In the meantime, many other Asian countries, in which the infection began to spread, reacted in an equally rapid and effective way. In particular, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong took timely and drastic measures, obtaining the rapid containment of the epidemic quickly and with a negligible increase in cases. The most probable explanation for this, is that all these countries were perfectly aware of the enormous risks associated with the spread of a pandemic virus, for at least two reasons: because of decades of experience in the prevention of the numerous potentially pandemic outbreaks originating in Southeast Asia; owing to the recent, dramatic experience of SARS faced in 2003 and subsequently studied with extreme attention, in order to avoid possible new outbreaks.

Unfortunately, the same scenario did not occur in western countries and, in particular, in Italy.

The Italian drama

As for the Italian situation on April 17
th
, the data appear to be critically extensive. In the first 50 days of the epidemic, 172.434 cases (22,745 dead) were identified mostly (> 80%) located in the 4 major northern regions: Lombardy (64.135/11.851 dead), Emilia-Romagna (21,834/2,903), Piedmont (19,803/2,171), Veneto (15,374/1,026). These figures are beyond those normally considered worrisome. The trend of deaths since February 25 followed a strictly exponential trajectory. Although it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions for mortality rates from the current epidemiological data in this first phase of the epidemic lethality rates (calculated on the basis of cases identified by PCR tests) appear very high, although with considerable variability from region to region. The most dramatic scenario occurred in Lombardy, one of the richest regions characterized by a high-level health organization. Nonetheless, 10,627 currently hospitalized patients, probably many more real deaths than the almost 12,000 officially registered (with a lethality rate close to 20%) and still 971 cases in intensive care units (ICU) have been already recorded in Lombardy. Much more dramatic data than those officially reported in China, where the lethality rates quickly plateaued at 3.5%. Not much better are the data from Emilia-Romagna where the lethality rates are slightly lower than 15% and Piedmont where the lethality rates are approximately 10% (in any case 3 times greater than in China). Slightly better are the lethality rates (around 6-7%) in the Veneto region, the only region of Northern Italy that immediately underwent strict containment measures, in open contrast to official government rules, significantly slowing down the spread of the virus. Evidently, these are really dramatic data: 20/30 times higher than those due to the common seasonal influence. To which it is necessary to add the number of ICU admissions, many of which have ARD, and are doomed to death. Undisputed data are that throughout Italy over 10-15% of those affected so far have died or been hospitalized in intensive care.

A situation that seems to have no precedent except, perhaps, in the Spanish Flu. In that case, however, the retrospective computation of lethality data was very difficult. Recently, an agreement has been reached on these figures: approximately 50 million deaths and 500 million infected in 1.8-2 billion people. Which would mean lethality rates oscillating between 2 and 10%, but mortality rate around 2.5%. Moreover, we should consider that a century ago developing a
cytokines storm
and an ARD generally meant death. So, it is not unexpected that young people frequently died, especially in the second epidemic wave, which was much more lethal than the first: a most worrisome possibility for the current COVID-19 pandemic. As for Asiatic flu (1957), the lethality cases seem to have been much lower: probably around 0.5-1% and even lower those of Hong Kong flu (1968), despite the lack of current therapeutic possibilities. Yet, it is evident that something does not work in such evaluations. And above all, how can we explain the dramatic situation in Northern Italy with very high lethal rates and thousands of ICU patients and the much less severe one in central and southern Italy?

The third avoidable risk factor: The partial and late application of the Chinese and Asian strategies

Many have so far interpreted the aforementioned data as the classic tip of the iceberg, in relation to a probable wide circulation of the new virus in the general population and a very large number of asymptomatic subjects. It is in fact probable that, if the evaluations previously described are true and the virus has been circulating, at least in the northern regions, for almost 2 months, the subjects infected and capable of infecting others could already be hundreds of thousands in Italy. In this case, the very high lethal rates that are creating panic would be an almost artifact. Indeed, it is evident that screening only symptomatic subjects by PCR test and not ascertaining or monitoring their contacts, means selecting the most severely affected among the infected without considering all those subjects who have already encountered the virus and have overcome mild forms of the disease and are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic. It is at least partly for these reasons that on the one hand in Italy lethality rates are much higher than in China, on the other hand the virus continues to circulate and expand freely.

Anyway, among the many important data that emerged from the WHO study in China, one does not seem convincing: that in most cases, those who meet the virus sooner or later become symptomatic. The data that appear every day in Italy and in other countries contradict this theory: the majority of people infected with the virus remain asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic and appear to be the most dangerous source of spread of the epidemic. And in fact, recently, researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health established that undocumented infections probably facilitated the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan, especially before the restrictions. According to their study, published in
Science
, 86% of all infections had not been recognized and these subjects, although presumably less infectious compared to the symptomatic ones, would have been the source of 2/3 of all infections. If these assessments are truthful, in Italy another fundamental mistake was to focus exclusively on serious cases, while in China it was immediately understood that it was necessary to test and monitor all cases and in particular the mild ones (anyone who had symptoms of fever, asthenia and cough) and anyone who had direct contact, especially if protracted, with them. It should be clear that if we only focus on serious cases, characterized by high and prolonged fever, asthenia, cardiovascular symptoms, high pressure, neurological and respiratory disorders, which according to Chinese data should be only 5% of the total, an early diagnosis will not be possible. And, above all, the dissemination of the virus, essentially occurring through the infected patients who are still asymptomatic, will not stop. Relying on these criteria, reserving testing to serious cases was a serious mistake, which the Asian countries did not make.

A drama in the drama, in Italy, concerns health professionals: according to the data released by the ISS, in Italy since the beginning of the epidemic, at least 17,000 health professionals have contracted the COVID infection (equal to 10% of the total number of people infected!) and 130 medical doctors deceased. These data are enormously worse than those of the Chinese cohort (3300 infected, 3.8% of the total number, and 23 deaths) reported in a study published in
JAMA
. It is increasingly evident that these events would have been largely avoidable if specific hospital/diagnostic paths had been set, and if health workers would have been properly informed and furnished with ""sufficient protective equipment"". A very serious fact not only on the moral and juridical level, but also for the consequences it will have. And this not only in Italy, but with increasingly dramatic evidence, in all Western countries.

Finally, what happened in China, but also in other Asian countries, demonstrates the importance of timely and correct information and the proactive and convinced participation of the population. The accurate and rapidly implemented surveillance also made it possible to make predictions on the evolution of the epidemic outbreak that proved to be accurate. After setting the starting point of the epidemic on December 8, the date of the first case diagnosed in Wuhan by the famous doctor Li, who unfairly censored unfortunately died, Chinese experts calculated that the peak would be reached in a few weeks; that the plateau would have been short, reaching around 85,000 total cases; that the outbreak would decrease and then shut down after about 100 days. At this point it will be difficult to predict what will happen in Italy and in the other western countries, where the restrictions have been implemented too late and gradually, without the accuracy of the Chinese and above all, as mentioned, only considering severe cases and significant clusters. As we can see (Fig. 2), the very
first divide
in epidemiological data concerns, on the one hand, Asian countries which, for the above-mentioned reasons, were able to cope drastically and effectively with the epidemic, on the other hand Western countries which having underestimated the pre-pandemic alarm and the virus itself were found unprepared.

Fig 2. The global divide: Asian versus Western Countries. The diffusion patterns of SARS-CoV-2 deaths number growth in different countries are outlined. Cumulative number of deceased is considered from the first day with 100 recognized cases. South Corea is taken as example of a country accustomed to dealing with this type of emergency and ""sensitized"" by SARS/2002 related pandemic warnings. Taken from
COVID Time Series Test
.

As for Italy, a similar epidemic gap is evident between the northern and southern regions. Indeed, the fact that the southern regions could benefit of a longer latency time between the first cases and the spread of the virus played an important role. We hypothesize that the fact of having been able to reduce the inflow of infected people in hospitals made the difference (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. The Italian divide. Cumulative growth of COVID cases number in three North Italian regions (Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia) and three South regions (Campania, Puglia, Sicilia) starting from the first case registered in Veneto. The six areas have a similar population size. The institution of the red zone was established 17-18 days after the tenth case in North Italy and 6-11 days after the tenth case in the South.

Unfortunately, as the days go by, it becomes more and more evident that many other western nations are destined to follow the fate of Italy. Starting from Spain, which in the last 20 days has gone from 39,670 cases/2696 deaths to 177,633 cases/18,579 deaths). Followed by France, which in the same period went from 22,025 cases/1100 deaths to 105,155 cases/17,146 deaths. And again: United Kingdom from 8081 cases/422 deaths to 98,480 cases/12,868 deaths. And finally, USA from 51,914 cases/673 deaths to 604,070 cases/25.871 deaths. And the rule becomes increasingly evident: a pandemic unfortunately accelerates inexorably, in countries that do not implement rapid and decisive containment strategies.

The fourth avoidable risk factor: Insufficient information and protection of the operators and the health system

The fourth error, which unfortunately is about to manifest itself in Italy and in all western countries all its dramatic relevance, derives directly from the first three and in particular from the underestimation of the pathogenic potential of a pandemic virus. It essentially consists of the insufficient information about the risks associated with a direct (and therefore massive) exposure to the new bug. Neither ordinary people, nor especially health workers, have been warned in time and adequately protected. Furthermore, our requests to quickly adapt to the emergency the National Health System and in particular hospital facilities were not taken into consideration.

In fact, because of the ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" (PHEIC) announced by the World Organization the New Coronavirus Emergency had already been announced, for six months, on 31 January, in The Official Journal of The Italian Republic, by a Decree of the Council of Ministers. Yet, the correct measures did not start even after the beginning of the outbreak. The golden standard for trying to stop a pandemic is to face it on the territory, safeguarding hospitals, as Asian countries have done (preparing for these emergencies for 30 years). We should have arranged alternative pathways to prevent the virus from entering hospitals through the emergency rooms: by organizing military hospitals and other alternative facilities for positive quarantine; by testing and monitoring interpersonal contacts; adequately protecting health professionals assigned to SARS CoV2 control; organizing hospital wards and in particular intensive care units only for COVID. Neglecting these basic rules, you risk turning hospitals into virus sanctuaries. After all, some article has indirectly recognized the possible role of hospitals in amplifying and perpetuating the epidemic. While the great part of health workers usually protect themselves from observable droplet transmissions, they are often unaware that asymptomatic transmit the virus even more often than symptomatic. Moreover, fomite transmission is frequently overlooked in hospitals. It has been proven that a very careful control of the correct management of the fomites plays an important role in the control of the pandemic. Unfortunately, western countries have shown not to be ready to face such events. Although the danger of a pandemic had been known for 20 years, a pandemic virus has been circulating in Europe for at least 2 months, without taking adequate precautions. Neither ordinary people, nor especially health workers, have been warned in time and adequately protected. Furthermore, our reiterated requests for to quickly adapt to the emergency the National Health System and in particular hospital facilities were not taken into consideration.

As regards the urgent and inevitably profound and articulated adaptation of the health system, a first reorganization proposed by us and uselessly solicited on several occasions, consists in the establishment of alternative corridors and dedicated medical areas that should be able to operate in coordinated succession:

A) in each region or province, a single extra-hospital center should be equipped primarily for initial triage, early diagnosis and immediate isolation of positive cases, characterized by mild symptoms (presumably about 80% of cases). Obviously, in this first center, the adequate protection of all the medical personnel assigned is already mandatory. It is extremely important to understand that this center will have to replace any other private and public structure with regard to the immediate approach to suspicious cases that must absolutely not go to private medical offices and hospital facilities. Equally important will be (as in Asian Countries) the research, the correct information and the monitoring of the contacts of all the positive subjects;

B) secondly, wards and hospital or extra-hospital structures should be organized, capable of administering supportive care to cases of medium severity (probably about 15%) needing, in particular, protracted (3/6 weeks), non-invasive oxygen therapy (NUV-Non Invasive Ventilation). Even in these cases, particularly accurate and protracted monitoring will be essential, because the sudden evolution of some towards more serious and acute forms does not seem rare;

C) In this way, only 5% of cases should reach the intensive care units (ICU), requiring intubation and assisted ventilation. In a situation such as the current one, it will be necessary not only to urgently strengthen the current intensive care units, but also to transform some wards normally used for long-term hospitalization, into wards adequate to cope with the emergency.

Lessons to be learnt

We started writing this article a month ago, in the belief that a correct analysis and evaluation of the mistakes made in Italy, the first western country hit by the pandemic, could have prevented the drama from spreading quickly to other countries. But in the 21
st
century pandemics spread through highways, super-fast trains and international flights and there is not enough time to imitate effective reactions (if you are not prepared in time), or to learn from the mistakes of others. At this point, the analysis of the mistakes made must be extended to all western countries if we do not want to risk being caught unprepared by a second wave of pandemic and in the face of other increasingly probable pandemic outbreaks.

In a nutshell, too many western experts underestimated the pandemic alarm and therefore the virus, which like all ""new viruses"" has recently gained both contagion/spreading modalities, and pathogenic mechanisms very different from the viruses known for some time to the human immune system. As a result, they did not look for suspicious cases from the beginning and when the first case was diagnosed it was already too late, since the virus was probably circulating in many countries at the end of December. However, it is clear that timely and effective choices would have been possible only if China had raised the alarm in time, rather than hiding the first cases. Nonetheless, we have to admit that western countries would still have found it difficult to react efficiently, due to the lack of experience and real experts in this area. In Italy, at least, this lack of experience has been very evident and harmful. Otherwise, would symptomatic cases be identified in time; the viral genomes of the ascertained cases sequenced; the phylogenetically probable path of the virus reconstructed, avoiding the wrong perception (unfortunately rapidly becoming international) of an almost indigenous, sudden and difficult to interpret ""Italian drama"". Especially since many experts, have continued to say that 2019nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was a common flu virus, which in most cases favored/accelerated the death of the elderly and debilitated subjects.

Based on these misunderstanding, many Italian experts (and consequently politicians) did not understand that it was necessary to immediately close, as in China, not only the areas of the first clusters, but entire regions, scrupulously checking the exposed population, monitoring and isolating the infected and their contacts, and above all preventing the circulation of the asymptomatic carriers of the virus. It is evident that the situation is critical today precisely in the areas of the first clusters and the first dissemination. In some cities of Lombardy, such as Bergamo and Brescia, the virus spread hurriedly, in the absence of any perception of the risk and even minimal precautions. This provoked the collapse of the system and the spread of panic, which probably facilitated, in turn, immuno-inflammatory reactions.

Yet, the main mistake that has produced the most painful consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy was the insufficient information and protection of health personnel and the failure to adapt the National Health System to an emergency that seems to be only at the beginning. It would be important, at this point, to take the correct precautions, to predict and adjust western sanitary services to the ""Worst possible scenario"", which with reference to modern pandemics is represented by the Spanish Flu of 1918-20, where the expansion of the pandemic progressed through sequentially more deadly steps. After a relatively massive beginning, partly explained and perhaps underestimated due to the concomitant First World War in the first months of 1918, the second, truly devastating wave reached at the end of summer and in less than a year resulted in the death of 40-100 million men, women and children. It is from here that we must start: faced with a situation that could last for months and reappear in an even more dramatic form at a later date, it would not be sufficient to maintain the current lockdown conditions for a long time, simply waiting for the epidemic to subside. It would be necessary to understand that containment measures can serve to slow down the spread of a pandemic, but must be integrated with a rapid and effective reorganization of the entire health system to address this and other future increasingly probable pandemic alarms. What China and other Far Eastern countries effectively accomplished has yet not happened neither in Italy nor in the rest of the Western world.

Emergence of the coronavirus worldwide represents a pandemic of enormous proportion. The problem was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
1
The number of infected patients increased rapidly to more than 60,000 within the next two months. Human airway epithelial cells were used to identify a novel coronavirus called Covid-19. It was linked to pneumonia which was associated with mortality of 11.5%.
2
Coronavirus pneumonia patients who died were found to have elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels (FDP) on admission and in late stages of the disease prolonged prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin times (PTT). Criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were found in (15) 71% of non-survivors and only 0.6% of survivors.
1
Chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, malignancy, respiratory diseases and kidney and liver abnormalities were found in 41% of the patients. During the late stages of the disease, fibrinogen and antithrombin levels were decreased along with markedly increased D dimer and FDP levels. Sepsis and consumptive coagulopathy were frequently seen.

It was postulated that these coagulation changes were based on a cascade of events beginning with inflammation and sepsis releasing inflammatory cytokines which caused increased circulating thrombin reflected in the D-dimer levels. The response to these changes was activation of the fibrinolytic system resulting in an elevation of FDP. This process involving inflammation activates coagulation resulting in increased circulating thrombin generation. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin that coats bacteria and viruses to physically entrap them and prevent their dissemination.

The increased thrombotic state can manifest as a variety of clinical presentations. The patient may exhibit evidence of a hypercoagulable state with development of clinical VTE. DIC may evolve into consumptive coagulopathy, and as the clotting factors are used up, the PT and PTT will become prolonged. This chain of events may become impossible to manage due to bleeding, and all resources must be brought to bear, including stopping or lowering the dose of anticoagulant drugs. Transfusion of blood, platelets, or plasma products may be necessary, as well as a trial of anti-fibrinolytic drugs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a last resort has been used selectively.
3

In a retrospective case series from Italy, involving 1591 coronavirus patients they found that 99% of 1300 patients with available respiratory support data required respiratory support, 88% required intubation and noninvasive ventilation was necessary in 11%. The ICU mortality was 26%.
4

Coagulation changes representing various stages of hypercoagulability due to the presence of inflammation, sepsis and/or pneumonia are not the only pathophysiologic issues in these patients. Most Covid-19 hospitalised patients are at high risk of VTE as a result of principles proposed in 1856 by Virchow, a brilliant German pathologist. He introduced the concept known as Virchow's triad describing three factors associated with development of venous thrombosis.
5
These include venous stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability. The risk is highest when all three factors are present.

Patients who are at bed rest, particularly due to hypotension, shock, coma, sedation or when mechanical ventilation is necessary, are at risk. Marked reduction of blood flow from the legs due to inactivity occurs. This phenomenon, known as venous stasis, results in pooling of venous blood while arterial inflow is not altered. Eventually veins become engorged with blood and this results in cracks in the venous lining (endothelial injury). This process exposes the blood to sub-endothelial collagen, triggering clotting as the blood is exposed to this foreign surface. Finally, hypercoagulability exists in the calf leg veins compounded by waste products from normal muscle metabolism that become trapped and further stimulate clotting. Compounding this increased clotting activity is the individual patient's degree of infection, sepsis, or pneumonia.

A thorough thrombosis risk assessment is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of these coronavirus patients. The Caprini score is a comprehensive history and physical examination involving 40 elements. The weight of each element present (risk factor) (e.g., 1,2,3,5) contributing to a thrombotic event is totalled to produce a final score. This score is plotted against the clinical incidence of VTE and a nonlinear increase in clinical events with increasing score has been observed. More than 5 million patients in more than 150 clinical trials have documented this association.
6

Coronavirus patients may be assessed with less complex scores but the Padua and Improve scores do not record family history of thrombosis or past obstetrical complications that may indicate the patient is a carrier of anticardiolipin antibodies or a beta2 glycoprotein abnormality.

The Caprini score can classify patients into low-risk, high-risk, or very-high-risk. Low-risk patients (scores 0-4) should not receive anticoagulant prophylaxis because it does not further lower the incidence of thrombosis, only increases bleeding complications.
7
It should be noted that this principle does not apply to coronavirus patients due to their high baseline thrombotic risk. In surgical patients without the virus, high-risk patients (scores 5-8) benefit from a course of anticoagulation of at least 7 to 10 days, and very-high-risk patients (scores 9+) benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis for up four weeks.
8

Patients admitted with coronavirus are all at increased risk of thrombosis and benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis. These patients should receive anticoagulant prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) unless there is increased risk of bleeding. Mechanical methods are relied upon in patients where anticoagulation is not suitable. The presence of respiratory involvement automatically dictates LMWH prophylaxis because it has previously been shown to result in a 75% reduction of VTE events.
9

The purpose of scoring is to identify very high-risk individuals with multiple risk factors present before the onset of the viral infection. It has been reported by Tang that 41% of patients have existing chronic disease.(1) Common examples include patients with a family history or past history of VTE, morbid obesity with a BMI over 35, or existing thrombophilia. Obese individuals frequently suffer from sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes requiring insulin, and cardiovascular disease. It is recommended that these individuals along with those with a score of 8+ be given twice the normal dose of anticoagulation. There are no randomised trials to substantiate this practice; however, the tendency of these high-risk patients to develop fatal and nonfatal thrombotic events plus the additional thrombotic risks associated with the virus appear to justify this approach.

The Caprini score is a dynamic instrument and needs to be updated as complications during hospitalisation occur. Rescoring of the patient during hospitalisation as complications develop may push patients with lower scores into the very high-risk group. At this point then, doubling the anticoagulant prophylaxis should be considered. Increasing the score by three points occurs when patients develop a positive d-dimer. Some investigators use therapeutic anticoagulation for those with 3x or more elevation of the d-dimer levels. There is a one-point increase when inadequate ambulation occurs. The definition of ambulation has been suggested by the data to mean that walking 30 feet at one time
decreases
the incidence of VTE by 50%.
10
Unfortunately going to the bathroom does not qualify as ambulation using these criteria.

A final Caprini score should be completed before discharge and those with a score of 8+ including those with a positive d-dimer may benefit from 6 weeks of anticoagulation facilitated by use of one of the new oral anticoagulants. Coumadin should be avoided due to the personal contact required for monitoring.

Haematologic changes signalling severe disease and a poor prognosis include one or more of the following: elevated D dimer, elevated fibrinogen or FDP, prolonged PT or PTT, and thrombocytopenia.

Some investigators have suggested screening patients who develop these changes with ultrasonography to detect subclinical thrombosis. Point-of-care ultrasound screening (POTUS) using a hand-held instrument at the bedside is advised. Limited examination including two-point ultrasound involving the femoral and popliteal veins is a practical approach. Others feel that scanning should be reserved for those with clinical indications including leg pain, swelling, etc.

In conclusion, accurate thrombosis risk assessment for all coronavirus patients is advised. Thrombosis prophylaxis is indicated for most patients and traditional anticoagulants help prevent most fatal thrombotic events. Appropriate VTE screening for select very-high-risk patients based on haematologic or clinical criteria is also advised. An aggressive approach for patients exhibiting clinical or laboratory features associated with DIC may be lifesaving.

COVID-19: Plummeting Stroke Admissions and New Protocols

By Kurt Samson

May 21, 2020

Article In Brief

Stroke neurologists in certain cities have seen fewer strokes in the emergency department, in large part, they contend, because people are nervous about calling 911 and going to emergency departments during COVID-19.

Yale School of Medicine Professor Kevin Sheth, MD, FAAN, noticed something unusual happening at Yale New Haven Hospital amid COVID-19's first surge in his area: There was a steep decline in emergency stroke admissions.

Over a period of a month, admissions had fallen by as much as 60 to 80 percent. At first, he assumed the drop-off was due to patients avoiding the hospital emergency department. ""Now, I'm not so sure,"" he wrote in a perspectives article published April 9 in the
Washington Post
.

""Lulls in stroke admission in normal times last a day or two, not weeks and they will be seen in one center, not across the board,"" said Dr. Sheth, chief of neurocritical care and emergency neurology at the hospital.

""In speaking with colleagues around the country, it is clear my medical center is not alone. Stroke volumes appear to be dropping almost everywhere, and the same may be true for heart attacks and other conditions, so I am more than a little concerned.""

Although still anecdotal, if patients with stroke symptoms are avoiding calling 911 or going to hospitals for fear of contracting the virus, neurologists need to make sure that at-risk patients and their families are made aware that stroke specialists and units remain ready to help if they or a loved one shows any signs of stroke, he said.

Fewer Admissions in Florida

At the University of Miami's McKnight Brain Institute, Executive Director Ralph L. Sacco MD, FAAN, professor and chair of neurology, told
Neurology Today
that Dr. Sheth's observations are similar to what he has witnessed himself, and that colleagues at hospital stroke centers in Florida have reported similar declines.

""We've all seen a reduction in emergency stroke admissions, notably in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. We're not sure why, but most of us believe that people are not calling 911 for mild-to-moderate symptoms, said Dr. Sacco, immediate past president of the AAN.

Dr. Sacco said that he recently reviewed a register of 120 centers around the state, and most have experienced similar declines in mild-to-moderate stroke admissions. ""We are still seeing the same number of severe strokes, but that isn't surprising because it's not something that a person can put off seeking emergency medical care.""

Evolving Protocols

Eliza C. Miller, MD, assistant professor of neurology and director of the Mothers Center Neurovascular Clinic at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, has witnessed the pandemic's impact from its epicenter in New York City.

""There has been a significant reduction in the number of acute stroke presentations to the ED here, although the numbers are starting to increase again,"" she told
Neurology Today
.

Dr. Miller told
Neurology Today
that there has been high-level coordination from NewYork Presbyterian/Columbia leadership and the state's regional stroke care system, to make sure that beds are available for all the patients who need them, and that she has not personally encountered a situation where they could not find a bed for an acute stroke patient.

""We have had to adapt many of our protocols. All the stroke team members have been very flexible about adapting on an almost daily basis to the changes that are happening. I am proud to say that I think there has not been any negative impact on stroke patients once they present to our emergency department.""

""In the ED, all stroke patients would be considered COVID-positive and treated as such till proven otherwise. Because the PPEs were precious and in short supply, we had to use them judiciously. We consequently quickly adapted the stroke code protocols so that only one individual would attend the stroke code (rather than the whole team) to save and preserve the PPEs.""--DR. KUMAR RAJAMANI

""The fact is that the diagnostic tests that we rely on, like MRI and angiograms, have all been impacted by the pandemic, but I havent heard of any stroke centers closing down entirely.""--DR. DAVID S. LIEBESKIND

The use of telemedicine has increased both in the hospital and on the outpatient side, she continued.

""We have transitioned all of our acute stroke care in the ED to telemedicine as first-line, with in-person backup as needed. Many stroke patients are not able to give a clear history of symptoms, so we have assumed that all acute stroke patients may have COVID-19 and have followed the appropriate protocols for protective equipment [PPE].""

This turned out to be a good decision, she told
Neurology Today
, because in many cases, they did turn out to have the virus.

""On the inpatient side, we have completely restructured our neurology teams to accommodate the large numbers of COVID-19 patients. However, our stroke patients with and without COVID-19 are still receiving the same level of care and services.""

""We have had to adapt many of our protocols. All the stroke team members have been very flexible about adapting on an almost daily basis to the changes that are happening. I am proud to say that I think there has not been any negative impact on stroke patients once they present to our emergency department.""--DR. ELIZA C. MILLER

On the outpatient side, she said, the stroke team transitioned all appointments to telehealth at least during the peak of the pandemic. For patients presenting to the ED with transient ischemic attack or minor stroke symptoms, or subacute strokes, they have obtained vascular imaging in the ED and then, in most cases, have discharged them to follow up the next day via telehealth with a vascular neurologist and complete an expedited outpatient evaluation.

""We were already implementing this at our institution pre-pandemic, but the use of telehealth for this is a novel addition. It's been an effective strategy for preserving inpatient beds for the COVID-19 patients.""

""I think telemedicine has come into its own during this pandemic, and vascular neurologists have led the way,"" Dr. Miller said. ""This expertise has been really helpful as we transition all kinds of things to telemedicine that didn't seem possible before.""

""Doing telemedicine well requires extremely good communication skills and ability to collaborate with the people who are on the ground with the patient, whether that's a family member at home, or an emergency department nurse who helps you examine the patient,"" she continued.

""One thing I like about outpatient teleneurology is that it allows me to have a direct view of how the patient is functioning at home, and what the particular challenges are. I think a combination of teleneurology and in-person evaluation is going to be the future of stroke medicine as long as it continues to be supported by the reimbursement structure. We should absolutely advocate for that.""

""I predict that post-pandemic, many of us will incorporate telemedicine into our practices to a greater degree that we did before,"" she said.

Stroke in Hard-Hit Detroit

In Detroit, hospital systems also have adapted stroke protocols in response to the COVID-19 surge. ""In our hospital system in Detroit, the COVID-19 patients started rolling into the emergency rooms by mid-March,"" Kumar Rajamani, MD, professor of neurology at Wayne State University School of Medicine and medical director of the stroke program at Detroit Medical Center, told
Neurology Today
.

""In the ED, all stroke patients would be considered COVID-positive and treated as such till proven otherwise. Because the PPEs were precious and in short supply, we had to use them judiciously. We consequently quickly adapted the stroke code protocols so that only one individual would attend the stroke code (rather than the whole team) to save and preserve the PPEs.""

An important early observation was the high incidence of thrombosis in especially continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), Dr. Rajamani said. The anticoagulation guidelines were rapidly modified to address the hypercoagulable state that COVID-19 patients experienced. The dosage of enoxaparin for prophylaxis was increased to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, for example, and high-risk patients based on D-dimer levels > 3 mg/L were recommended for full-dose anticoagulation even without clinically obvious thrombosis. The team actively monitored these patients for bleeding, he added.

Dr. Rajamani said acute kidney injury was noted to be a significant finding in seriously ill COVID-19 patients, often with a need for CRRT. For patients with ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusion, fairly large doses of iodinated contrast agents for CT angiogram and perfusion imaging for visualizing the site of vessel obstruction and the viable penumbra has been used and shown to be safe in the pre-COVID era, he noted.

""Because we started noticing severe renal injury in these COVID-19 patients, one couldn't be certain whether it was the effect of the iodinated contrast dye or the underlying disease,"" Dr. Rajamani said. ""Whether the contrast agents remain as safe in the COVID-19 era is something we are still uncertain about; we are monitoring every patient closely and looking at the overall risk-benefit ratio.""

""For patients with ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusion that need endovascular treatment, we very early decided we will provide this standard of care in a safe manner for all concerned,"" Dr. Rajamani said. ""The only change to the protocol in COVID-19 patients has been elective intubation of these patients to maintain adequate control during the procedure.""

Stroke Centers Stand Ready

David S. Liebeskind, MD, FAAN, director of UCLA's Comprehensive Stroke Center, said changes are also underway at the center.

""We've already seen different management styles evolve with COVID-19,"" Dr. Liebeskind told
Neurology Today
. ""There are a lot of different approaches.""

At UCLA's Stroke Center, a backup system is in place to ensure that acute stroke patients are treated as quickly as possible, he said.

""The team is in place, and we have three-deep backup coverage. That's the good news: The stroke center is up and operating.""

When someone has milder stroke symptoms, it isn't always clear-cut, and hospitals need to position themselves to encourage anyone with symptoms to come forward sooner rather than later, he continued.

""People are avoiding hospitals if they have mild-to-moderate symptoms, but we have to be careful of our reaction to this because even mild symptoms require proper evaluation. What has emerged in the current scenario is our health care system adapting as best it can to treat patients with other medical conditions while integrating COVID-19 treatment into an evolving crisis treatment scenario,"" he said.

""The fact is that the diagnostic tests that we rely on, like MRI and angiograms, have all been impacted by the pandemic, but I haven't heard of any stroke centers closing down entirely.""

Guidelines from the American Stroke Association

On April 1, the American Heart/Stroke Association's Stroke Council Leadership issued special guidelines for treating patients presenting with stroke symptoms, and several other organizations and individuals have published various strategies for overcoming obstacles to stroke care during the current crisis.

The AHA/ASA guidelines, published in
Stroke
, recommend that vascular neurologists adhere to treatment guidelines for patients to ensure appropriate stroke care is provided to the extent possible during the crisis; seek ways to minimize the use of scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) and reduce the number of team members responding to emergency stroke patients; and increase the use of interactive videoconferencing in the remote delivery of acute stroke care, among other strategies.

The guidelines also recommend that stroke neurologists continue to deliver multidisciplinary, collaborative stroke care to patients for a unified stroke system of care; and ask medical personnel who are exposed or contract COVID-19 to self-quarantine as appropriate."

Based on Chinese CDCP report on COVID-19, 14% of patients presented severe disease and 5% critical conditions. The average case-fatality rate was 2.3%, but mortality was as high as 49% in patients with critical illness. Serious life threatening thromboembolic complications have been found in 71*4% of non-survivors and micro/macro angiopathic coagulopathy has been found, also at autopsy, with highly increased neutrophil number, fibrinogen, concentrations of D-dimer and FDPs and NETs, ATIII decrease and normal number of platelets. A cytokine storm and interaction between inflammation and coagulation has been advocated as explanation of hypercoagulability. In this paper, it's hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection of alveolar cells induces recruitment of innate responder neutrophils, which release proteases and NETs inducing endothelial damage/endotheliopathy and imbalance of the four major proteolytic cascades (coagulation, complement, fibrinolysis and kallikrein) with prevalence of activators over inhibitors and consequent thrombotic complications. Platelets adhesion to damaged endothelium and the presence of ULVWF multimers, due to decreased ADAMTS13, contributes to the state of hypercoagulability. Neutrophil innate ""unfriendly fire"" response can be identified as the trigger of a ""proteolytic storm"", responsible for subsequent well known prothrombotic condition and ""cytokine storm"". The hypothesis explains also the pathology of recently described systemic ""Kawasaki Disease like"" vasculitis cases in Covid-19 young ill patients.

Experience in adults with diabetes shows that they are prone to faster metabolic decompensation, develop diabetes-related complications, and have a poor prognosis when hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on children are limited. The aim of this mini-review is to discuss the possible risks to children and adolescents with diabetes during the current pandemic and the special considerations in management in those affected with COVID-19. The challenges for children who develop new-onset type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 lockdown, especially in accessing healthcare, are also discussed.

Abstract

In this article we will review the imaging features of COVID-19 across multiple modalities, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and ultrasonography (US). Given that COVID-19 primarily affects the lung parenchyma by causing pneumonia, our directive is to focus on thoracic findings associated with COVID-19. We aim to enhance radiologists' understanding of this disease in order to help guide diagnosis and management.

Summary

The purpose of this review is to describe the spectrum of radiological features seen in coronavirus disease 2019 across multiple imaging modalities and provide an overview of their clinical utility in both the diagnosis and management of patients.

Essentials

* Describe the clinical utility and imaging features of the modalities most commonly used in diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19, namely chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT).

* Describe the clinical utility and imaging features of the modalities less commonly used in diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

* Describe the clinical utility of chest ultrasonography and echocardiography in COVID-19, specifically as a point of care evaluation in the emergency room or intensive care setting for both diagnosis and evaluation of extent of lung disease and complications such as pulmonary embolism and right heart strain.

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can be nonspecific and diagnosis is confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab test. The test is highly specific, however the sensitivity is reportedly as low as 60-70% due to insufficient viral load or failure of nucleic acid extraction.
2
,
3
The high rate of false negative results, particularly early in disease time course, and the inconsistent availability of testing means that a systematic approach to diagnosis must be employed, including the use of radiological imaging. While chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are not an official component of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 in the United States, CT, and less frequently CXR, have been used to support the diagnosis, determine severity, guide treatment and assess treatment response.
4

Still, without consensus, there may be a role for other imaging modalities as well. Preliminary investigators have suggested that chest ultrasonography (US) may play a useful role in early diagnosis, particularly as a point of care service.
5
Given the role that inflammation may play in COVID-19's pathophysiology and progression, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has also been explored.
6
-
8
At the time of writing, no reports on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of COVID-19 have been published with respect to pulmonary findings and only a few case reports have been published with respect to cardiac related disease; however, images are included in this review. The utility of echocardiography in evaluating patients with COVID-19 is also discussed. The growing incidence of extrathoracic and thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19 are described as well. The role and potential applications of artificial intelligence, which is playing a burgeoning role concurrent with these various modalities will also be considered.

Clinical Presentation

COVID-19 typically presents with lower respiratory manifestations. Nonspecific signs and symptoms include fever, dry or productive cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Less common symptoms include myalgia, headache, sore throat, and chills.
9
Gastrointestinal symptoms are much less frequent, but may occur.
10
Anosmia and hyposmia are reported in up to two thirds of those infected, and may be the only clinical manifestation particularly in children and young adults.
11

Special Circumstances Related to Workflow and Technique

The stresses of COVID-19 on a radiology department have caused alterations to workflow that have varied based on institution and country. COVID-19 has forced both academic and private radiology practices to adjust to significant decreases in outpatient imaging volumes, which has impactful economic ramifications. When chest CT is indicated, it may be performed without contrast according to the department's standard chest CT protocol without change to technical parameters, although some have adopted a low-dose protocol because abnormalities can be readily detected at reduced radiation doses.
14

Chest Radiography

For most patients who present with COVID-19, the first, and possibly only, imaging evaluation is a solitary portable anteroposterior chest radiograph. Length and severity of infection at the time of image acquisition affects appearance on CXR. In conjunction with clinical findings such as symptomatology and oxygen saturation, appearance on CXR can aid in assessing severity of illness and guiding management.

Unfortunately, many patients who are positive for COVID-19 on PCR testing will have a falsely negative CXR result.
15
There are multiple reasons for a normal CXR in COVID-19 positive patients including lack of lung involvement at the time of presentation, acquisition early in disease course, and subtlety of findings on CXR, particularly on more limited portable anteroposterior (AP) radiographs. As a result, CXR findings have been reported to have a lower sensitivity than initial RT-PCR testing (69% versus 70-91%, respectively).
16

When baseline CXR is positive, COVID-19 manifests with consistent findings, the most common of which is hazy opacification, the likely radiographic correlate of ground-glass opacity (GGO) seen on CT.
17
The opacities are sometimes rounded in morphology and have a peripheral and lower lung distribution (
Figure 1A
). Lung findings may be unilateral or bilateral and as the disease progresses, more of the mid to upper lungs may be affected. While uncommon, isolated opacities can appear in the upper lobes in the setting of mild disease.

Figure 1:
PA chest radiography (A) of a 29 year old female with no past medical history who presented to the emergency room with four days of fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, diarrhea, and myalgias, shows faint peripheral rounded opacities in a lower lung distribution (arrows). Chest radiograph (B) of a 40 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented from a group home with a fever, cough and shortness of breath of duration one week demonstrates diffuse bilateral opacities with dense consolidation in the mid to lower lungs. Portable chest radiograph (C) of an intubated 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with one week of fever, cough, congestion, and myalgias. On his seventh day of admission, 14 days after symptom onset, chest radiography demonstrates multiple bilateral diffuse hazy pulmonary opacities. The patient was noted to have elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, IL-6, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and fibrinogen. All patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing and the patient in C died two days later.

As the disease progresses and becomes more severe, the opacities may coalesce and become denser, presenting as patchy consolidative opacities (
Figure 1B
). These findings typically peak 10-12 days after symptom onset. Additionally, pulmonary opacification may become diffuse, mimicking the imaging (and clinical) presentation of diffuse alveolar damage, such as may be seen in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (
Figure 1C
).

While two-view posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiography is the ideal radiographic technique, portable AP CXR is adequate in assessing parenchymal findings associated with COVID-19. By employing portable radiography, hospitals can limit transport of these highly contagious patients as well as exposure to radiology staff. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that COVID-19 patients receive only portable CXR as their primary means of imaging assessment.
16
Performing serial portable CXR allows the radiologist and the treatment team to monitor progression of disease within the lungs. In addition, assessment of lines and tubes and potential complications such as pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumomediastinum can be performed (
Figure 2
).

Figure 2:
42-year-old male with no past medical history other than obesity intubated in the intensive care unit. Chest radiography demonstrates diffuse dense opacities with small bilateral pneumothoraces (arrows) in addition to severe bilateral neck and chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. The etiology of the air leak is unknown but suspected to be related to mechanical ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings, a finding that has been previously associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing.

Computed Tomography

While CXR remains an adequate screening and assessment tool for COVID-19 in most patients, chest CT is far more sensitive, with early reports of up to 97% sensitivity.
3
CT can detect early disease, as occult or subtle hazy opacities on CXR appear as readily identifiable GGOs on CT (
Figure 3
). The typical findings of COVID-19 on chest CT are multiple bilateral GGOs (57%) with or without consolidation (29%), often with a rounded morphology and peripheral and lower lung distribution.
18
Sublobar and segmental consolidation, though less common, can also be seen (
Figure 4
). On CT, GGO is defined as hazy increased lung attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins while consolidation refers to denser opacification that obscures vessel margins and airway walls. Pure GGO lesions are characteristic of mild or early COVID-19 pneumonia with progression on serial CTs showing increased lung involvement and development of mixed attenuation (the second most prevalent pattern). In addition, GGO with superimposed interlobular septal thickening and visible intralobular lines (""crazy paving"") may be present, particularly later in disease time course.
15

Figure 4:
Chest radiography (A) and axial non-contrast chest CT (B) of a 27-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with a fever, vomiting, and myalgias of duration three days demonstrate dense consolidation in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe (arrows). The patient was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing. This single upper lobe involvement represents an atypical pattern of disease without any figure 9associated identifying factors in the patient's history or presentation.

CT abnormalities progress rapidly after symptom onset and are reported to peak between days 6-13 of the illness.
19
,
20
In later and more severe stages, consolidation can become the predominant abnormality and can become diffusely distributed with a more reticular configuration (
Figure 5
). There is an expected but variable pattern of resolution and healing thereafter--an evolution consistent with organization and fibrosis that occurs after any form of acute lung injury.
21
In one study, 66 of 70 patients (94%) discharged from the hospital had residual disease on their latest CT scans, most often GGO.
19

Figure 5:
Axial chest CT following intravenous contrast administration in the lower lungs of a 30-year-old male former smoker with a history of asthma who presented with fever, cough, and left lower back pain three weeks after symptom onset. CT demonstrates extensive dense patchy consolidation with relative subpleural sparing, most severe in the lung bases. Throughout the patient's hospital course, he required supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and was noted to have elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. The patient was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing.

Less commonly reported imaging findings include subsegmental vascular engorgement(defined in studies as peripheral vessels measuring more than 3 mm diameter) in areas of lung opacity; in one study, this was observed in 89% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, and may be related to pro-inflammatory factors or infection-induced hyperemia.
22

Another relatively infrequently reported finding is the atoll sign (or ""reverse halo"" sign) on CT, defined as a rounded area of more lucent ground-glass opacity surrounded by a complete or almost complete ring of denser consolidation.
15
This finding is typically encountered in the subacute to chronic stages of lung injury with the development of organization and early fibrosis, which may be a reason why the earliest COVID-19 investigators found this imaging feature to be infrequent (
Figure 6
). Of note, the atoll sign can also be concerning for pulmonary infarction.
23
In this clinical context, patients should undergo further workup for pulmonary embolism, either through chest CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or venous duplex ultrasonography when CTPA is contraindicated; these considerations are discussed in further detail below. The CT halo sign, defined as consolidative nodules/masses surrounded by ground-glass opacity, is another atypical finding reported in COVID-19. It has also been seen in other viral pneumonias, angioinvasive fungal infections, hypervascular metastases, and vasculitides and may be related to perilesional hemorrhage or edema.

Figure 6:
Coronal chest CT of a 73-year-old-female with a history of hypertension and lupus and hospitalized for worsening respiratory status. Follow-up CT 30 days after initial symptoms demonstrated widespread reticulation with geographic regions of bronchiectasis and ground-glass opacity (GGO) and clear demarcations between spared lobules, consistent with an organizing pattern.

It is noteworthy that early in the disease, there is a notable absence of pleural effusions, lung cavitation, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and discrete pulmonary nodules (e.g. centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud opacities).
17
,
21
,
24

The imaging findings of COVID-19 represent an interesting form of acute lung injury that progresses to an ARDS-like picture with patterns that overlap with organizing pneumonia of any etiology.
25
Distinguishing COVID-19 infection from other conditions with similar CXR and CT findings requires consideration of all clinical information, exposure history, and alternative diagnoses.
26

Regarding diagnostic capability, CT boasts an impressive sensitivity (~94%) in detecting COVID-19. However, the overlapping features described above result in a poor specificity (~39%), leading to concerns over its use in screening (citation). A recent meta-analysis comparing CT and RT-PCR demonstrated that CT possessed a low positive predictive value and a concomitant risk of high false-positive in low-prevalence areas.
27
In areas with high prevalence, the benefit of diagnostic use must be considered against the risks of radiation and infection.

In addition to its utility in identifying early parenchymal lung disease and evaluating disease progression, chest CT can identify alternative or concurrent diagnoses, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities. As discussed below, there are increasing reports of hospitalized patients developing coagulopathies and pulmonary thromboembolism; therefore, we anticipate that the role of CTPA for patients with COVID-19 will become more defined.
4
In particular, CTPA has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool specifically in the risk stratification and diagnosis of hemodynamically stable patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism, as evidenced by high Well's score, revised Geneva score, or d-dimer value.
28
In this group, prognosis has been shown to be correlated with central localization of emboli.
29
CTPA can further be used to determine extent of clot burden, document right heart strain, assess for reflux of contrast, and elucidate potential complications such as pulmonary infarct.

MRI

To date, the pulmonary MRI imaging features of COVID-19 have not been described. Currently, cardiac MR is not being performed for many patients with elevations in troponin or suspected myocardial injury related to myocarditis as part of a risk and benefit related to infection control measures. Due to the overwhelming prevalence of the disease, MRIs performed for various indications, including cardiac, vascular, and upper abdominal MRI, can demonstrate incidental findings related to COVID-19 in the pulmonary parenchyma. The pulmonary distribution of COVID-19 on MRI is consistent with CT and CXR, including basilar and peripheral predominant disease. On MRI, the parenchymal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia appear as regions of abnormal increased signal intensity on both T1 and T2-weighted sequences, corresponding to the ground-glass or consolidative opacities seen on CXR and CT (
Figure 7
). Cardiac MRI may also have some useful applications as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have been described in COVID-19 patients.
31
With only two reported cardiac MRI cases in the literature to date, the cardiac MRI findings of COVID-19 would be expected to be consistent with myocarditis, showing regional or global wall motion abnormalities on cine Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP), more diffuse rise in T1 relaxation values on T1 mapping, late gadolinium enhancement in a mid-myocardial or transmural pattern, and if acute, signal hyperintensity representing edema on ECG gated black blood T2 weighted sequences.

Figure 7:

T1-weighted axial MRI with intravenous contrast of the abdomen and pelvis incidentally noted peripheral signal intensity abnormalities in the right lung base (arrow). The patient subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing.

Extrapulmonary MRI features of COVID-19 in the brain are discussed below.

PET/CT

Although fluorodeoxyglucose (
18
F-FDG) PET/CT is not used in emergency settings, it can identify inflammatory processes in the lungs, monitor disease progression, and evaluate disease following treatment. During viral infection, the host response triggers a rapid surge of inflammatory mediators including neutrophils, monocytes, and chemokines. In the setting of acute infection, neutrophils depend on anaerobic glycolysis to maintain cellular activity. This increase in glucose requirement is reflected by a concomitant increase in FDG uptake on PET/CT.
33

Figure 8:
33-year-old male with history of HIV and treated Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing PET/CT, for oncologic restaging. Fused PET/CT imaging (B) shows bilateral peripheral predominant intense sites of FDG avidity that correspond to ground-glass and mixed attenuation opacities on CT (A). A maximum standardized uptake value of 9.98 was seen. The patient was asymptomatic at time of imaging but presented to the emergency department ten days later after developing hypoxia with 85% oxygen saturation on room air. The patient was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with PCR testing.

Additional utility of FDG-PET may be established in the future. Proposed applications include the monitoring of treatment response, prediction of recovery, and surveillance of long-term sequelae as FDG-uptake may be correlated with healing times.
34
Furthermore, extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported, which will be discussed below.
10
,
35

37
PET/CT has potential as a whole-body non-invasive examination to assess chronic end-organ complications. What might be most relevant, however, is the potential increase in incidental findings of COVID-19. PET/CT is regularly indicated for oncologic staging, and reports exist of the incidental discovery of COVID-19 pneumonia on nuclear medicine exam.
38
To this end, nuclear medicine services should anticipate these findings and prepare accordingly.

Ultrasonography

Chest ultrasonography (US) has been useful as a point of care (POC) evaluation in emergency and intensive care settings.
39
Reports have cited lung US as valuable for imaging of acute respiratory failure and have advised bedside US use in the emergency department (ED) setting for prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
40
,
5
Commonly reported findings include thickened pleural lines, B lines (multifocal, discrete, or confluent), consolidative patterns with or without air bronchograms (
Figure 9
), and A lines during the recovery phase.
40
Some prospective studies have reported superior sensitivity of lung US in diagnosing pneumonia when compared to CXR.
41
Many physicians in the ED or intensive care unit (ICU) settings have advocated for the widespread adoption of POC US, touting its ease of use, repeatability, low cost, absence of radiation exposure, and triage optimization.
42
In particular, its lack of ionizing radiation makes it appealing for children and pregnant patients. Published data regarding the risk of disease transmission to ultrasonography technologists is currently unavailable; however, this consideration should be noted when determining appropriate use of resources.

Figure 9:
Lung ultrasonography of a 17-year-old male being treated for COVID-19, on bilevel positive airway pressure in the pediatric ICU, shows consolidation in the left lung with multiple echogenic foci representing ""air bronchograms"" (arrow).

Moreover, a notable role of US imaging has arisen in the context of COVID-19 induced coagulopathy. Increased clot burden and thrombosis risk has been well documented in infected patients.
43
Furthermore, patients have demonstrated increased baseline levels of prothrombin time, d-dimer, and other inflammatory markers.
44
With the interpretation of d-dimer tests being skewed in acutely hospitalized patients, the use of upper and lower extremity vascular ultrasonography will undoubtedly rise in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Echocardiography

In institutions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 infection, DVT and peripheral thrombosis are common complications due to associated hypercoagulability and clinicians have observed a concomitant surge in incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE).
45
As these cases continue to emerge, the use of echocardiography is expected to increase as it has been widely validated and adopted for use in high-risk hemodynamically unstable patients (""massive"" PEs).
46

Its main role in this specific population is in confirmation and prognostication for PE. Many studies have corroborated the ability of echocardiography to detect secondary right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, a highly sensitive and poor prognostic factor.
47
,
48
Thus, echocardiography is a powerful tool in the stratification of patients with acute PE, similar to CTA as discussed earlier. It is not useful as a screening tool due to its low sensitivity and high rate of false positives in diagnosis of PE.
47
Furthermore, it lacks the ability to visualize the pulmonary vessels.

Highly specific echocardiographic signs of acute PE include right heart thrombus, McConnell's sign (akinesis of the right ventricular free wall and hypercontractility of its apical wall), and paradoxical interventricular septal movement.
49
With respect to RV dilatation, current guidelines from the American Society Echocardiography define thresholds as ventricular diameter of greater than 42 mm at the base and 35 mm at the mid-cavitary level.
50

Similar to chest US, POC echocardiography might have particular utility in ICU settings. The sensitivity of right ventricular dilatation in the detection of PE using POC echocardiogram has been reported as high as 90%.
51

Echocardiography is also indicated for evaluation of COVID-19 related acute cardiac injury as it can identify cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock as a cause of decompensation. Furthermore, abnormalities on echocardiography are associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis.
52

Artificial Intelligence

The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) during this pandemic primarily relate to its potential for high-throughput analysis and pattern recognition of imaging findings. In institutions with high disease prevalence and limited resources, the number of imaging studies requiring evaluation accumulates rapidly. Parallel AI processing of images can facilitate triage of patients. Furthermore, the rapid progression of disease necessitates frequent CT scanning during hospitalization to monitor therapeutic response. Although qualitative evaluation is valuable, subtle changes across serial CTs might be overlooked. Computerization can aid in quantification of these changes and subsequent trend analysis to track disease progression in an individual or population.

The centerpiece of clinical AI lies in the plasticity of deep learning networks which allows these systems to adapt to various manifestations of pathology. Early AI investigators have begun to lay the groundwork for more detailed exploration of deep learning algorithms to rapidly screen for, identify, and quantify disease in the setting of an acute pandemic.
53
-
57

Early studies have reported proof-of-concept establishing the feasibility of developing such algorithms using lung segmentation and quantitative opacity measurements.
53
,
58
Published sensitivities and specificities have been high, with values for each reportedly in the high 90th percentile.
56
,
57
Further efforts have been devoted towards differentiating COVID-19 from other causes of pneumonia, with similarly promising diagnostic results.
54
,

The limitations of deep learning in radiology are inherent to its image-based framework. To develop an adequately discerning program, teaching algorithms require thousands of studies. Furthermore, these studies must possess adequate quality. When segmentation quality is insufficient, appropriate quantification is impossible.
58
Finally, in all radiological deep learning methods, it is not possible to determine which imaging features are being used to determine output. Many use heatmaps to ameliorate this issue by highlighting vital regions, but these alone are still insufficient in determining the ultimate key diagnostic features.

Thromboembolic Manifestations of COVID-19

The association between COVID-19 and coagulopathy has been described in literature showing that elevations in coagulation markers such as PTT and D-dimer were increased in COVID-19 patients and also associated with increased mortality.
59
,
60
,
61
A presumed consequence of this coagulopathy was described by two centers in France which showed an association between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism.
62
,
63

The hypercoagulability seen in COVID-19 may result in deep venous thrombosis, manifesting as filling defects on doppler ultrasound or venous phase CTs. (
Figure 10
). In the unfortunate situation that these clots dislodge and migrate to the heart, a pulmonary embolism can form, creating filling defects detectable on CT angiography (
Figure 10
).

Cases of non-cerebral arterial thromboembolic disease have also been reported and may involve the celiac trunk or renal arteries, leading to downstream hypo-perfusion changes (
Figure 11
).

Cerebral infarction has also been described in association with COVID-19, with a recent series reporting large vessel occlusions in young patients, raising the suspicion for a thromboembolic etiology.
64
,
65
These infarcts may be evident on non-contrast CT as hypoattenuated large vessel territories or on CT angiography as focal arterial occlusions (
Figure 12
).

(B) Axial CT Angiography in the same patient demonstrates thrombus in both renal arteries (arrows) with associated hypoperfusion changes in both kidneys.

Additional Extrapulmonary Manifestations

A number of extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported, including in organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract, brain, heart and kidneys.

37

A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may develop acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rare complication which has been previously described as a complication of influenza and other viral infections. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to an intracranial cytokine storm, which can result in blood-brain-barrier breakdown, despite the lack of inflammatory cells seen in the brain parenchyma, such as the case with other types of encephalomyelitis.
66
Reported lesions of COVID-19 associated ANE demonstrate hypoattenuation on head CT localized to the bilateral medial thalami. MRI features include T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity and internal hemorrhage indicated by hypointense signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, often with rim enhancement on T1-weighted post-contrast imaging. Similar to CT, reported MRI findings have been located in the thalami, but also other midline structures such as the medial temporal lobe and the subinsular region.
67

Further study will be needed to assess the role of abdominal imaging for possible associated secondary findings of enterocolitis and hepatitis.
10
Reported CT findings of COVID-19 associated enterocolitis include bowel wall thickening with associated pericolic fat stranding, mural hyperenhancement and mesenteric hypervascularity (supplementary figure). Distribution can be rather variable, ranging from single segment to pancolonic involvement.
68
,
69
, What is more specific, however, is the pattern of ground glass high-density area that can be seen around the intestinal wall, which is not characteristic of bacterial enterocolitis.

Conclusion

This multimodality imaging review provides information on the spectrum of COVID-19 thoracic imaging findings on CXR, CT, MRI, PET/CT, US, and echocardiography (
Table 1
). The features described dovetail with findings of other early investigators. Our CXR and CT observations add to the growing body of evidence that multilobar, predominantly peripheral and basilar ground-glass and mixed attenuation opacities are the most common thoracic imaging findings. Given its poor sensitivity for detection of mild pulmonary changes, CXR can be insensitive for detection of early or mild disease but is useful in triaging patients and monitoring care in those with radiographically detectable pneumonia. CT changes are now understood to demonstrate a pattern of temporal evolution typical of organizing pneumonia as a response to acute lung injury. Chest US, particularly in POC evaluation, has been helpful, and the appearance correlates well with CT findings. The MRI and PET/CT findings have yet to be comprehensively described, but our sample MRI and PET/CT images demonstrate that they correspond closely to characteristic CT imaging appearances. Extrathoracic and thromboembolic complications manifest across multiple modalities. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection are not yet well established.

On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
1
Twenty-three days after that announcement, the cases reported reached 1,056,777 in 182 countries, with 55,781 deaths, most of which occurring in Italy, Spain, France, China and Iran. So far, Brazil has registered 8,195 cases and 335 deaths, while Portugal, 9,886 cases and 246 deaths, figures that have increased steeply since the beginning of the pandemic.
2

In the face of this exponential increase, mainly in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, multiple safeguarding measures to prevent further spread of the virus, such as school dismissal, event cancellations, reduced bank hours, closure of commerce, except for essential sectors, recommendation for home confinement, and cancellation of public transportation between municipalities and states, have been taken in Brazil, as well as in Portugal and other countries. In the absence of a vaccine and specific therapy, that is actually the only way to restrain viral spread and to prevent the health system overload, which might lead to its collapse, as seen, for example, in Italy and Spain. Person-to-person spread via respiratory droplets disseminated during sneezing, coughing and talking, as well as transmission through contact with contaminated surfaces justifies those measures.
3
The PCR assay for viral RNA detection on respiratory tract samples has been used for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19; moreover, wide-scale testing has been adopted to contain the pandemic in other countries.
3
Other types of tests are being developed to assess the population acquired immunity. These tests identify individuals who have developed immunity to the virus, and who can therefore safely return to their usual activities. This will be essential in the second phase of the pandemic.

Analyses by the Imperial College with projections from the COVID-19 cases have estimated, if no action is taken, 7 billion infections and 40 million deaths worldwide in 2020. Furthermore, they have reported that mitigation strategies focused on protection could cut that burden in half, saving 20 million lives, but not without overloading healthcare services, a situation that might be even more severe in lower income settings.
4
This scenario should be avoided at any cost by implementing strict measures that limit the movement of people, as well as social distancing or even isolation. It is worth noting that underreporting, undertesting and delayed confirmatory test results might jeopardize the statistics of any country that does not adopt a strict policy for test performance, as recommended by the WHO.

A study conducted in China with 72,314 patients with COVID-19 (44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 16,186 suspected cases, and 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases) has reported mild clinical severity in 81.4% of the sample, severe clinical severity in 13.9%, and critical clinical severity in 4.7%.
3
The most common symptoms were fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea.
3
,
5
Other signals and symptoms have been reported, such as sore throat, chest pain, mental confusion, and lethargy.

Almost 5% of the infections will have a severe course with acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary bleeding, severe lymphopenia, kidney failure, circulatory shock, and failure of multiple organs.
3
,
5
The case-fatality rates by age group in Italy (1,625 cases) and China (1,023 cases) differed substantially, 7.2% and 2.3%, respectively, which can be partially explained by the older age distribution in Italy, as well as the presence of more comorbidities among Italians.
6

One fourth to half of the patients with COVID-19 have chronic conditions, especially cardiovascular (CVD) and cerebrovascular diseases, which increase the risk for a severe course of disease and death. A meta-analysis of six studies conducted in China, including 1,527 patients with COVID-19, has assessed the prevalence of CVD and reported the following proportions: hypertension, 17.1%; heart and cerebrovascular diseases, 16.4%; and diabetes, 9.7%.
7
Another study with 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China has shown preexisting comorbidities, such as CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6%), which related to a case-fatality rate of 2.3%.
3
Those studies have evidenced the importance of not only chronic diseases but also of age and host immune
status
to COVID-19-related mortality, characterizing a complex, multifactorial and bidirectional model that can comprise the drugs used to treat those pathologies.
8
,
9

Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications have been observed and attributed to several mechanisms, such as relative ischemia, systemic inflammation and pathogen-mediated damage, with increased levels of biomarkers, such as troponin I, BNP, and d-dimer.
9
-
11
Myocardial damage was observed in 7.2% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, shock in 8.7%, and arrhythmia in 16.7%, leading to intensive care admission.
9
A meta-analysis with four studies, including 341 COVID-19 patients, has reported a significantly higher standardized mean difference in cardiac troponin I levels in patients with severe disease as compared to those with milder disease (25.6; 95%CI: 6.8-44.5 ng/L).
10
In a retrospective multicenter cohort study in China, elevated d-dimer levels at admission (> 1ug/mL) have been associated with in-hospital death even after adjustments (OR 18.4; 95% CI: 2.6-128.6 ug/mL).
11

Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 has been reported, probably due to vascular inflammation, hypercoagulable states and endothelial dysfunction.
8
Fulminant myocarditis and heart failure have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; moreover, preexisting coronary artery disease has been associated with a possible predisposition to that infection.
12
-
14
In a case series with 150 patients with COVID-19, 7% of the 68 deaths were attributed to myocarditis with circulatory failure.
12
Other studies have described fulminant myocarditis with high viral load and the post-mortem finding of mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the heart tissue.
13
,
14
New and important knowledge was recently presented in a case report: the lack of any pulmonary manifestation in a patient with myopericarditis and significant left ventricular dysfunction, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was successfully treated with dobutamine, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroids, chloroquine, and the usual medical therapy for heart failure.
15
In another study, heart failure has been observed in 23.0% of the COVID-19 patients, being associated with non-survivors (51.9% vs. 11.7%); in addition, the contribution of previous ventricular dysfunction to that outcome remains inconclusive.
11

Murine models and human post-mortem samples have shown that SARS-CoV can regulate the myocardial and pulmonary angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediating myocardial inflammation, pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure, and might explain the cardiovascular involvement of severely ill patients.
16
However, data available are still insufficient to determine whether these observations readily translate to humans, and no study has evaluated the effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.
17

Some studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can up-regulate ACE2, thus increasing susceptibility to the virus; other studies, however, have shown that ACEI / ARB can potentialize the pulmonary protective function of ACE2.
18
,
19
The Brazilian Society of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend the individualized assessment of the patient, suggesting that the abrupt withdrawal of therapeutic schemes currently being practiced should not be performed, as that might cause clinical instability and adverse health outcomes.

At the current time there is neither a vaccine against nor a specific treatment for COVID-19. Chloroquine blocks the viral infection by increasing the endosomal pH necessary for the virus/cell fusion and has shown an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2
in vitro
. Ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir are antiviral drugs being tested in prospective studies. It is worth noting that the lopinavir/ritonavir association alters heart conduction, with QT-interval prolongation and advanced atrioventricular block. In addition, those drugs interact with antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, statins and beta-blockers .

When approaching patients with COVID-19, cardiologists should be alert to new clinical manifestations, such as arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction and systemic embolism, which might be related to that condition, since there is much that is still unknow about it.

The COVID-19 pandemic came to change, in a previously unimaginable way, the dynamics and functioning of societies worldwide. The challenges are gigantic, mainly concerning the strain they represent to national health systems, which have never been submitted to such a radical stress test. However, this can also be an opportunity to reorganize and strengthen health systems, and, at the same time, to highlight the pivotal role of health professionals in our society. Policymakers should pursue the most effective way to guarantee the sustainability of health systems, while ensuring that healthcare professionals receive just reward and due recognition for their effort and dedication, often ignored in times of Peace.

The world has responded to this scenario of global crisis with unprecedented widespread solidarity. In light of the enormous challenges that lie ahead, we must ensure that this matter remains close to heart.

Abstract
Introduction: Despite the new SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) be the seventh of the coronavirus family viruses known to cause human disease, little is known about potential symptoms and syndromes secondary to the compromise of the central and peripheral nervous systems. We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease.
Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders.
Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group.
Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.

Abstract

In late December 2019 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing severe pneumonia (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. A common finding in most COVID-19 patients is high D-dimer levels which are associated with a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and whole blood thromboelastometry profiles in a group of 22 (mean age 67 +- 8 years, M:F 20:2) consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Padova University Hospital for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls (
p
< 0.0001 in both comparisons). Interestingly enough, markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients, as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time (CFT) in INTEM (
p
= 0.0002) and EXTEM (
p
= 0.01) and higher Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM (
p
< 0.001 in all comparisons). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy. Fibrin formation and polymerization may predispose to thrombosis and correlate with a worse outcome.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded ribonucleic acid viruses that usually infect birds, mammals, and humans. Human CoVs may cause respiratory, enteric, and neurological affections.[
1
] In late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Provence, China. Thereafter, many countries reported similar cases, leading to the discovery of a novel CoV. In February 2020, the World Health Organization named SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early reports showed that very high D-dimer levels are common in COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate with a worse prognosis.[
2
] To better characterize COVID-19-related coagulation changes, we investigated traditional parameters and whole blood thromboelastometry profiles in all consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Padua University Hospital between March 7 and 19 2020 for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. Exclusion criteria were: known preexisting congenital bleeding or thrombotic disorders and/or preexisting acquired coagulopathies, active cancer and/or chemotherapy, pregnancy, and ongoing anticoagulant therapy. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were recorded. A group of 44 healthy, age-, sex-, and body weight-matched subjects served as controls for laboratory data. Within 30 minutes of ICU admission, venous blood samples were drawn from each enrolled patient into two BD Vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, United States) containing sodium citrate 109 mmol/L (3.8%) and one BD Vacutainer tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 5.4 mg. In all enrolled patients, hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin, and D-dimer were measured. Whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were obtained using a ROTEM delta apparatus (Instrumentation Laboratory - Werfen, Barcelona, Spain), as previously described.[
3
] INTEM and EXTEM assays (evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways) and FIBTEM test (evaluation of fibrinogen contribution to blood clot) were performed in each enrolled patient. The following ROTEM parameters were analyzed: (1) clotting time corresponding to the initiation phase of the clotting process; (2) clot formation time (CFT) reflects the measure of the propagation phase of whole blood clot formation; (3) maximum clot firmness (MCF) is the maximum amplitude in millimeters reached in thromboelastogram; and (4) area under the curve (mm*100), defined as the area under the velocity curve, that is the area under the first derivative curve ending at a time point that corresponds to MCF.[
4
] The protocol was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and notified to the Institutional Ethical Committee of Padua University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient when possible or relatives and from each control. Statistical analysis was performed using the PASW Statistics 17.0.2 (SPSS Inc.) for Windows. Continuous variables were expressed as mean +- standard deviation and categorical variables as number and fraction (%). The parametric

was used to test for differences between variables, when appropriate. A
p
-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

Coagulation profiles observed in our study population reflect a severe hypercoagulability rather than a consumptive coagulopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation). Such a laboratory pattern and association can be linked to both markedly increased levels of fibrinogen and an excessive fibrin polymerization due to the infection. SARS-CoV-2 is likely to promote massive fibrin formation and deposition which can also account for the very high D-dimer levels found in these patients.[
2
] Fibrin deposition in alveolar and interstitial lung spaces, in addition to microcirculation thrombosis,[
5
] may contribute to worsen respiratory failure resulting in prolonged mechanical ventilation, poor prognosis, and death. Furthermore, other major venous thromboembolic events and arterial complications (e.g., acute myocardial infarction) have been reported[
6
] and are likely to be largely underestimated. Notably, 5 (23%) of our patients developed an in-hospital deep vein thrombosis despite anticoagulant prophylaxis. In this regard, anticoagulant therapy may improve the prognosis in COVID-19 patients as reported by Tang et al.[
7
] In light of the severe hypercoagulable state observed in these patients, effective anticoagulant prophylaxis should be considered to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications. Unfortunately, our data did not allow to assess the impact of adequate dosages of anticoagulants on clotting parameters. Measuring antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) activity in plasma was deemed as the most accurate way to monitor therapeutic dosing of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, the anticoagulant used in our study). However, we were not able to evaluate anti-Xa activity in our study as it should have been measured 4 to 6 hours after the last injection of LMWH (peak level) whereas we collected blood samples immediately after admission to the ICU and thus at varying times from the last administration of heparin. It bears noting that if on the one hand thromboelastometry has the advantage to provide a global assessment of whole blood's ability to clot, on the other hand it is not able to evaluate the contribution to clot formation of each element (e.g., endothelium, platelets, and clotting factors). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present with severe hypercoagulability due to hyperfibrinogenemia resulting in increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may predispose to thrombosis. Larger studies are needed to define new therapeutic strategies to limit hypercoagulability and improve outcomes."

COVID-19 may predispose patients to an increased risk of thrombotic complications through various pathophysiological mechanisms. Most of the reports on a high incidence of thrombotic complications are in relation to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, while the evidence about arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 is limited. We describe four cases of aortic thrombosis and associated ischemic complications in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although COVID-19 begins as a respiratory pneumonia, we are now discovering it causes an intense inflammatory response accompanied by systemic microangiopathy. In reflecting on Virchow's triad, we considered the possibility that extreme elevation in acute phase response proteins like fibrinogen may result in hyperviscosity, a known cause of endothelial damage and resultant thrombosis. We found elevations in plasma viscosity in all 15 COVID-19 patients tested to date. Notably, the patients with the highest plasma viscosities experienced thrombotic complications despite receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Plasma viscosity correlated strongly with illness severity (Pearson's r = 0.841, p <0.001). Given the growing evidence of thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19, the role of hyperviscosity in disease pathogenesis should be examined more widely. Therapeutic plasma exchange is a mainstay of treatment for immunoglobulin-related hyperviscosity, where symptomatic hyperviscosity is considered a medical emergency. Study of its use in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who have thrombotic complications despite therapeutic anticoagulation is urgently needed.

Abstract

Central to COVID-19 pathophysiology is an acute respiratory infection primarily manifesting as pneumonia. Two months into the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed a neurological component to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. The observed symptoms, the cause of which remains unclear, included impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle injury and acute cerebrovascular disease, and appeared more frequently in severe disease. Since then, findings from several studies have hinted at various possible neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the historical association between neurological complications and highly pathological coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We draw from evidence derived from past coronavirus outbreaks, noting the similarities and differences between SARS and MERS, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We end by briefly discussing possible mechanisms by which the coronavirus impacts on the human nervous system, as well as neurology-specific considerations that arise from the repercussions of COVID-19."

Abstract

Objective

Acute stroke remains a medical emergency even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients with COVID-19 infection present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms; while others present with atypical gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological manifestations. Here we present a series of four patients with COVID-19 that presented with acute stroke.

Methods

We searched the hospital databases for patients that presented with acute stroke and concomitant features of suspected COVID-19 infection. All patients who had radiographic evidence of stroke and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in the study. Patients admitted to the hospital with PCR- confirmed COVID-19 disease whose hospital course was complicated with acute stroke while inpatient were excluded from the study. Retrospective patient data were obtained from electronic medical records. Informed consent was obtained.

Results

We identified four patients who presented with radiographic confirmation of acute stroke and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course.

Conclusions

Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke. Stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and should dawn appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient. Further studies are urgently needed to improve current understandings of neurological pathology in the setting of COVID-19 infection."

Abstract

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, now named as SARS-CoV-2, caused a series of acute atypical respiratory diseases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease caused by this virus was termed COVID-19. The virus is transmittable between humans and has caused pandemic worldwide. The number of death tolls continues to rise and a large number of countries have been forced to do social distancing and lockdown. Lack of targeted therapy continues to be a problem. Epidemiological studies showed that elder patients were more susceptible to severe diseases, while children tend to have milder symptoms.

COVID-19 pandemic--a focused review for clinicians

Abstract

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant issue for global health, economics and society. A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.

Objectives

Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.

Sources

We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.

Content

We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.

Implications

The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality."

BACKGROUND

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity to link host genomic factors to the highly variable clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been widely recognized.
1
,
2
The overt motivation for this research is the clinical implementation of any new insights to improve clinical management and foster better patient outcomes.

Human infection is a complex interaction between the microbe, the environment, and the human host.
3
Variation in the human genome has only rarely been linked to complete resistance to infection by a specific microbe; far more commonly host genomic variability has been linked to complications associated with infections (see Table
1
).
3
,
4
,
5
In this pandemic, the ability to identify host genomic factors that increase susceptibility or resistance to the complications of COVID-19 and to translate these findings to improved patient care should be the goal.

Several approaches can be taken to uncover relevant host genomic factors. Familial and population-based linkage analyses and analyses of extreme phenotypes can uncover monogenic variants contributing to COVID-19 clinical outcomes.
6
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
7
,
8
and multiomic-based approaches can be used to uncover common variants and biological networks underlying host-pathogen interactions. Likewise, data derived from genomes, such as HLA haplotypes, ABO blood groups, and polygenic risk scores (PRS),
9
can be used to understand COVID-19 susceptibility, resistance, and complications. Furthermore, biobanks linking genomic data to electronic health records (EHRs)
10
can be leveraged to investigate the impact of these genomic factors on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Many recognize that this area of research needs to go forward in a manner that is proactively inclusive of traditionally underserved populations to both avoid the exacerbation of existing health-care disparities and to optimize discovery. Past efforts have demonstrated the value of this type of inclusion, as was seen in the extension of a
CCR5
-associated delta 32 correlation to HIV-1 infection in individuals with European ancestry to a promoter variant in
CCR5
linked to perinatal HIV-1 transmission in individuals with African ancestry.

As host genomic factors are discovered, new strategies supporting rapid clinical implementation should be trialed to realize improvement in outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Implementation will require an infrastructure to deliver relevant genomic results to infected patients and their health-care providers to guide clinical management. This commentary examines the types of genomic factors that might be identified in emerging COVID-19 discovery and implementation research, based on decades of genomic discovery, research into other human infections, and advances in genomic medicine.

PHASES OF PHENOTYPE ASCERTAINMENT IN THE COVID PANDEMIC

In this fast-moving pandemic, we believe there will be at least
two phases
to defining COVID-19 related phenotypes. Currently in the United States, we are in an
initial phase
when important limitations influence the ability of research teams to ascertain and appropriately define phenotypes of interest. These limitations include (1) the absence of widespread viral and serologic testing to accurately distinguish those who have been infected from those who have not, (2) the lack of knowledge about infection exposure at a community level, and (3) institutional limits to recruiting human subjects in a time of social distancing. Heterogeneity of testing strategies and their sensitivity, and nascent regulatory oversight may pose challenges in clear and reproducible definitions of COVID-19-related phenotypes. In the
second phase
, adequate serologic testing may allow for increased numbers and more accurate discrimination of cases and controls, as well as the ability to define additional clinical phenotypes of interest (e.g., asymptomatic seropositive individuals). The use of telemedicine, which has expanded for health-care delivery during the pandemic, in addition to community outreach efforts, can overcome barriers to recruitment in this infectious disease outbreak.

To find important genotype-phenotype correlations, there will need to be phenotypes that are ascertained in a manner that is clear, quantitative, and reproducible, and there will need to be adequate sampling from well-defined cases and controls. One rubric that can be used for phenotyping during this
initial phase
of COVID-19 host genomic research is the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in their blueprint for therapeutic trials (see Supplemental Table
1
).
14
For instance, this scale can be applied across research groups and across health systems in order to allow phenotypic groupings of COVID-19 patients based on (1) need for hospitalization, (2) need for oxygen supplementation, (3) progression to respiratory failure, or (4) mortality, and these phenotypes could be readily extracted from EHRs. In the current initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, difficulties with the enrollment and appropriate scoring of uninfected, asymptomatic, or mildly affected patients (categories 0-2 in Supplemental Table
1
) are anticipated. Specifically, asymptomatic positives will be mistakenly scored as 0 instead of 1 without either viral screening or serologic testing. In addition, patients who would be scored 0-2 are difficult to recruit and consent given the social distancing limitations that are currently in place. As serologic testing becomes more sophisticated, widespread, and robust, it is anticipated that COVID-19-related phenotyping will become more standard, facilitating reproducible and scalable COVID-19 research.

CANDIDATE GENES AND PATHWAYS

At least three lines of inquiry might inform the nomination of candidate genes for intensive interrogation with COVID-19 phenotypes: (1) what do we know about the microbial life cycle, (2) what do clinical observations in patients suggest with regard to biological pathways that are likely being triggered, and (3) what does the literature teach us about host genetics in infection that could apply to this novel infection. For example, the cellular surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus is encoded by the
ACE2
gene, and critical amino acid residues in the binding interaction have been described.
15
,
16
This and other insights into host-pathogen interactions will elucidate specific variants, genes, and pathways underlying interindividual COVID-19 susceptibility and response. Genes and pathways related to COVID-19 could also include other viral receptor genes (e.g.,
TMPRSS2
) (unpublished data:
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047878
), inflammatory and immune response pathways (e.g.,
IL-6
pathway), and genes involved in hypercoagulability and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
17
Other genes that may be of interest include genes associated with ABO blood group (e.g.,
FUT2
) in light of a report on an association between blood groups and COVID-19 in China (unpublished data:
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096
) as well as similar associations in the past.
18
Research into the genetics of the interplay between viral infection and common diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) is also of interest to many investigators. As our understanding of genes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and biological mechanisms grows, we will better elucidate their potential involvement in disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes.

GENOME-SCALE APPROACHES FOR DISCOVERY AND RISK PREDICTION

In tandem, the global scientific community has rapidly mobilized collaborative efforts to advance unbiased genome-wide COVID-19 host genomic discovery through large-scale genomic studies. For example, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative is organizing analytical activities across a growing network of over 120 studies to identify genomic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.
1
It is difficult at this stage to estimate the number of research participants needed to identify host genomic factors related to the COVID-19 novel pathogenic exposure. If we assume that the effect size and allele frequency of genetic variants important for COVID-19 susceptibility, resistance, and/or complications are as variable as other host factors in infectious conditions (i.e., Supplemental Table
1
), then the number of cases and controls needed to have statistical power to identify associations could vary widely. Collaborative efforts like the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative should be well-powered for the unbiased discovery of novel genes and pathways. Such efforts foster data aggregation and sharing broadly among the research community and are likely to greatly impact the speed with which COVID-19 discoveries can be made and disseminated worldwide.

In aggregate, knowledge of host genomic factors could lead to improved care for patients with COVID-19, through risk stratification, as well as targeted prevention and treatment options. For example, GWAS discovery efforts could yield PRS for COVID-19 clinical outcomes, which could be used in the context of other clinical data to risk stratify patients early in the disease course. Host genomic factors could be linked to variability in the protective immune response and have implications for vaccination strategies, or could be used to optimally select patients for novel therapeutic treatments and trials. However, as it can take many years for genomic discoveries to directly benefit patients,
10
in parallel we need to prepare our health systems with infrastructure to rapidly integrate high quality, clinically relevant COVID-19 host genomic findings into the care of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

CONCLUSIONS

The COVID-19 pandemic currently threatens to overwhelm health-care systems and undermine economies. There is no proven therapeutic and no vaccine for the novel coronavirus causing this pandemic. In this moment, we emphasize the sentiments voiced by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, namely that ""[i]nsights into how to better understand and treat COVID-19 are desperately needed. Given the importance and urgency in obtaining these insights, it is critical for the scientific community to come together around this shared purpose.""
1

As the community works together to develop a COVID-19 host genomics research engine, we are poised for novel discovery and advances in genomic medicine. A model to understand human genomic variants linked to COVID-19 outcomes can be conceived as a continuum from ultrarare to common. We offer Supplemental Table
2
as a way to think about findings that can be expected from this research.

These include DVT formation as well as pulmonary embolism and stroke. Currently, the exact mechanism as to why COVID-19 patients are at higher risk for thrombotic complications has not been determined. It has been thought to be due to endothelial injury, blood stasis or a hypercoagulable state [

]. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of phlegmasia cerulea dolens in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19.

A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of right leg pain, swelling and discoloration. He reported a fever and dry cough which began three weeks prior. He stated his symptoms had resolved and he returned to work one day prior to his ED visit. His past medical history was significant for a motor vehicle collision 9 years prior that required multiple surgeries and as a result he developed a DVT and had an IVC filter placed. He had no other significant medical history and did not take any medications. Vitals signs in the ED were: temperature 36.8 degC, heart rate 85 bpm, blood pressure 107/59 mm/Hg, respirations 18, pulse oximetry 100% on room air. Physical exam revealed the right lower extremity to be purple and diffusely swollen from the groin to the toes and tender (
Fig. 1
). Pulses were not palpable; however, they were detected via Doppler. His calf was firm, his range of motion was limited due to pain and his capillary refill was delayed. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable.

Fig. 1
Patient's legs at time of presentation to the emergency department.

Ultrasound revealed occlusive thrombus beginning in the right external iliac through the common femoral, femoral and popliteal veins and into the calf. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the medial right middle lobe, thrombus within the distal IVC, right common and external iliac vein, and a possible thrombosed right proximal gonadal vein. He was started on heparin in the ED and vascular surgery and the medical intensive care unit (ICU) were consulted. The decision was made to give 50 mg of intravenous alteplase. Labs revealed elevations of: D-dimer 17,300 ng/mL, c-reactive protein 4.8 mg/dL, high-sensitivity troponin-T 23 ng/dL, basic natriuretic peptide 612 pg/mL, ferritin 813.8 ng/mL, fibrinogen 106 mg/dL, lactic acid 5.8 mEq/L, and IL-6 19 pg/mL. Rapid COVID-19 was positive, and PT/PTT/INR were normal. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management. He was continued on heparin and transitioned to oral anticoagulation and discharged home on hospital day 7.

Coagulopathy has been studied in both the critically ill, ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Thrombotic complications include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and systemic arterial embolism. Critically ill ICU patients had a 31% increase in these complications when compared to non-ICU patients in a study from the Netherlands and France [

], increasing the risk of thrombosis and complication. Our patient did have an elevated level of IL-6, in addition to hypertension and elevated CRP, which are all independent risk factors for increased severity of COVID-19 infection [

], both of which have been associated with thrombotic complications. Our patient was later found to have an elevated cardiolipin IgM, which could have theoretically contributed to his thrombosis. Other viral infections have been associated with aPL antibodies and thrombotic complications [

]. One patient of interest in their report also had evidence of ischemia in the lower extremities. Although it cannot be determined if patients had positive aPL antibodies prior to COVID-19 infection, it is known that aPL antibodies have demonstrated pro-thrombotic complications in patients [

While not all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 develop thrombotic complications, it is important for emergency physicians to consider COVID-19 as the cause of a patient's hypercoagulable state even if symptoms have improved. The use of anticoagulants for thrombus prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 infections is an area under investigation. The use of inflammatory markers and other laboratory values can also be utilized as an indication of a patient's clinical course as they progress through treatment.

Previous studies suggest a role for systemic reprogramming of host metabolism during viral pathogenesis to fuel rapidly expanding viral proliferation, for example by providing free amino acids and fatty acids as building blocks. In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.

Initially known as a predominantly respiratory disease, there is currently no doubt that COVID-19 is increasingly emerging as a prothrombotic condition. Observational studies, as well as published and anecdotal case reports have highlighted the thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19, with particular emphasis on the strong association between D-dimer levels and poor prognosis.
1,2
While the COVID-19 clotting narrative has been dominated by venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolism (PE),
3-5
macro-thrombosis of the coronary
6
and cerebral circulations
7
have also been reported, as have the prevalence of microthrombi arising from endotheliitis in other sites.
8

The pathophysiology

Some authors have described this SARS-CoV-2 induced hypercoagulability as 'thromboinflammation', an interplay between inflammation and coagulability leading to sepsis-induced-coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 cases.
9
The pathophysiology is still incompletely understood but may be largely explained by the three components of Virchow's triad:

Endothelial dysfunction:
SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is widely expressed not only in the alveolar epithelium of the lungs but also vascular endothelial cells, which traverse multiple organs.
8
Varga, et al. reported this concept of COVID-19 'endotheliitis' in their paper, explaining how endothelial dysfunction, which is a principal determinant of microvascular dysfunction, shifts the vascular equilibrium towards vasoconstriction, organ ischaemia, inflammation, tissue oedema, and a procoagulant state, leading to clinical sequalae in different vascular beds.
8
Complement-mediated endothelial injury leading to hypercoagulability has also been suggested.
10

Hypercoagulability:
SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercoagulability has also been attributed as a consequence of the 'cytokine storm' that precipitates the onset of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, resulting in the activation of the coagulation cascade.
11,12
However, whether the coagulation cascade is directly activated by the virus or whether this is the result of local or systemic inflammation is not completely understood.
12

Stasis:
Critically ill hospitalized patients, irrespective of pathophysiology are prone to vascular stasis as a result of immobilization.
13

Currently available data: predominantly observational studies

In some of the earliest data emerging from Wuhan, Tang, et al. reported significantly higher markers of coagulation, especially prothrombin time, D-dimers and FDP levels, among non-survivors compared to survivors of SARS-COV2 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), suggesting a common coagulation activation in these patients.
1

Subsequently, Zhou, et al., reported that D-dimer levels, along with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with .
14
This was highlighted in one of the earliest CCC-ACC webinars on COVID-19 in March 2020, by Professor Cao, who drew emphasis on their data where D-Dimer >1mg/mL was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death, with an odds ratio of 18.42 (p=0.0033).
14,15

In another single centre study among 81 severe NCP patients from Wuhan, Ciu, et al., observed that D-dimer levels >1.5 mg/mL had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 88.5% for detecting VTE events.
3
In an observational study of 343 eligible patients by Zhang, et al., the optimum cutoff value of D-dimer level on admission to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 ug/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%.
16

With a shift in the epicenter of the pandemic, data from Europe highlighted the prevalence of both arterial and venous thrombotic manifestations among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, many of whom received at least standard doses of thromboprophylaxis.
5,13

Most recent data from an observational cohort of 2,773 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York, showed that in-hospital mortality was 22.5% with anticoagulation and 22.8% without anticoagulation (median survival, 14 days vs 21 days).
17
Confounded by the immortal time bias, among others, these data underscore the pressing need for well-designed RCT's to answer this burgeoning therapeutic dilemma.

Antithrombotic therapy: What is the guidance?

As physicians learn more about this clotting conundrum, there is an increasing need for evidence-based guidance in treatment protocols, especially pertaining to anticoagulation dosing and the role of D-dimers in deciding on optimum therapeutics.

International consensus-based
recommendations
published by Bikdeli, et al. in the Journal of American College of Cardiology on 15
th
April 2020 recommend risk stratification for hospitalized COVID-19 patients for VTE prophylaxis, with high index of suspicion.
11
They further state that, as elevated D-dimer levels are a common finding in patients with COVID-19, it does not currently warrant r
outine
investigation for acute VTE in absence of clinical manifestations or supporting information. For outpatients with mild COVID-19, increased mobility is encouraged with recommendations against the indiscriminate use of VTE prophylaxis, unless stratified as elevated-risk VTE.

The majority of panel members considered prophylactic anticoagulation to be reasonable for hospitalized patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 without DIC, acknowledging that there is insufficient data to consider therapeutic or intermediate dose anticoagulation; the optimal dosing however, remains unknown.
11
Furthermore, extended prophylaxis, with low-molecular weight heparin or direct oral anticoagulants for up to 45 days after hospital discharge, was considered reasonable for patients with low-bleeding-risk patients and elevated VTE (i.e. reduced mobility, comorbidities and, according to some members, elevated D-dimer more than twice the upper normal ).
11

A Dutch consensus published shortly after on the 23
rd
April 2020, also recommends prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients, irrespective of risk scores.
12
Imaging for VTE and therapeutic anticoagulation recommendations are largely guided by admission D-dimer levels and their progressive increase, based on serial testing during hospital stay, in addition to clinical suspicion. A lower threshold for imaging has been recommended if D-dimer levels increase progressively (>2,000-4,000 mg/L), particularly in presence of clinically-relevant hypercoagulability. However, in contrast to the consensus document published in JACC, the Dutch guidance recommends that, where imaging is not feasible, therapeutic-dose LMWH without imaging may be considered if D-dimer levels increase progressively (>2,000-4,000 mg/L), in settings suggestive of clinically relevant hypercoagulability and acceptable bleeding risk.
12

The need for RCT's

Even as we scramble to clarify the pathophysiology, the urgency to establish evidence-based standard of care in terms of anticoagulation has never been greater. Dosing is a matter of hot debate (prophylactic versus intermediate versus therapeutic), especially considering the risk of bleeding that can arise from indiscriminate anticoagulation.

Furthermore, while we have data that underscores increased coagulation activity (D-dimers in particular) as a potential risk marker of poor prognosis, D-dimers remain non-specific and there is insufficient evidence as to whether they can be used to guide decision-making on optimum anticoagulation doses among patients with COVID-19.

The existing evidence on thrombotic complications and their treatment has been primarily derived from non-randomized, relatively small and retrospective analyses. Such observational studies have been hypothesis generating at best, and in the absence of robust evidence, randomized clinical trials are imperative to address this critical gap in knowledge in an area of clinical equipoise. And there are quite a few to watch out for, as evidenced by a quick search in Clinicaltrials.gov, some of which are already recruiting.

Currently recruiting at University Hospital, Geneva, this trial randomizes 200 hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 to
therapeutic
anticoagulation versus
thromboprophylaxis
during hospital stay. The primary endpoint is a composite outcome of arterial or venous thrombosis, DIC and all-cause mortality at 30 days.

This randomized, open-label trial sponsored by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) commencing recruitment mid-May, will randomize 300 participants with elevated D-dimer > 1500 ng/ml to therapeutic versus
standard of care
anticoagulation in a 1:1 ratio, based on MGH COVID-19 Treatment Guidance. Designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation, primary outcome measures include the composite efficacy endpoint of death, cardiac arrest, symptomatic DVT, PE, arterial thromboembolism, MI, or hemodynamic shock at 12 weeks, as well as a major bleeding event at 12 weeks.

A cluster-randomized trial of 100 participants, IMPROVE-COVID, sponsored by Columbia University will compare the efficacy of
intermediate
versus
prophylactic
doses of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome measure is the composite of being alive and without clinically-relevant venous or arterial thrombotic events at discharge from ICU or at 30 days (if ICU duration >=30 days).

Even months later, COVID-19 continues to baffle clinicians. But what has been crystal clear right from the outset is that there is no alternative to evidence-based practice, and it stands true in the face of this clotting conundrum as well.

On March 11 2020, following a 13-fold rise in COVID-19 cases outside China, the WHO declared the disease a pandemic. The novel coronavirus
is
now spreading in exponential proportions across the globe, crippling even some of the best healthcare systems. There are unprecedented events: there's a sense of uncertainty, and for most of my generation, this is the ""war"" of our time. Times like these also call for a collective responsibility, for each of us to do our part. We are in this together, for the long haul. And I mean that in the most literal, least metaphorical way possible.

The epidemiology explained

An epidemiological study of the outbreak in China estimated the basic reproduction number (R
0
) o
f
COVID-19 to be 2.68.
1
That essentially means that early on, every COVID-19 infected person can transmit the disease to an average of 2.5 others.

The epidemic
doubling time of COVID-19 is 6.4 days.
1
That means every 6-7 days, the number of cases increases by a
factor
of two.
Exponential growth
.
This is the reason why the spread can be seemingly slow initially, only to lead to a sudden outbreak in a matter of days to weeks. It's also why reducing transmission as
early
on in the outbreak as possible can dramatically reduce this exponential explosion of cases.

Social distancing & ""flattening the curve""

Social distancing is key to slowing down rates of transmission and might very well be the most responsible act in the face of this pandemic. This includes keeping a safe distance (at least six feet) between others, avoiding social gatherings, public transport, non-essential travel/ commutes and working from home, if one can. Needless to say, these measures must be accompanied by the consistent practice of healthy hygiene.

And it works:
these
simulation graphics by Harry Stevens of the Washington Post are a superb demonstration of the impact of social distancing on halting disease transmissions.
2

The concept of ""flattening the curve"" alludes to reducing the number of cases over time by slowing the rate of transmission of the disease so that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed beyond capacity. COVID -19 can be fatal in anyone, with the elderly and those with comorbidities such as diabetes, heart and lung diseases at higher risk of severe infection.
3
Latest reports from the WHO now emphasize that young people are not off the hook either, with data from countries showing that people under 50 make up a significant proportion of patients requiring hospitalization.
4

The fundamental idea of social distancing is to reduce disease transmission to EVERYONE, not just oneself. The incentive is not just preventing oneself from catching it. Even seemingly healthy individuals might develop a milder or asymptomatic form of the disease, retaining the ability to transmit it to the elderly (the worst hit) and other vulnerable groups they encounter, including young people. This leads to a rapid growth of the pandemic, overwhelming the healthcare systems beyond their capacities. An overwhelmed health care system will not be able to treat all the COVID-19 cases coming its way, and will also be limited in resources to care for someone who has a heart attack, an accident or cancer.

However, turns out staying at home is easier said than done, with some still struggling to grasp the concept. ""I'll just be a while, what can happen?"" they'll say. At a time, where testing for COVID-19 is also rationed, staying away from large gatherings is ever so much more important, especially when one shows symptoms. In the fascinating case of Patient 31 of South Korea, we see the dangerous potential of a ""super-spreader"" phenomenon, in a 61-year-old woman who by virtue of attending religious gatherings prior to testing positive for COVID-19, transmitted the disease in large clusters, leading to a sudden surge of cases in South Korea.
5

Sharing information: Responsible information, not misinformation

In a pandemic such as this, there's also a tendency for rampant misinformation, easily transmitted through social media channels. This calls for the responsible dissemination of information, and while this is applicable to everyone, the onus is more so on healthcare personnel.

With the volatility of the situation and the torrent of information flooding in from multiple sources, it can be difficult to sift between what's reliable and what isn't. These are some reliable channels you can turn to for correct information and updates. It's also important to seek out your local source of information depending on geographic location.

Show solidarity

Check on your elderly friends and relatives. Refrain from hoarding essential items, thereby potentially creating a shortage, making things difficult for senior citizens and those living on a daily wage.

For healthcare personnel and their families, this can be a particularly overwhelming time. Some of us may not be on the frontlines, but have friends and family who are. Just those words, ""on the frontlines"", sends a chill down my spine.

But that's exactly what this is. War. War against a common enemy. And when you're going to war, you don't make light of the prep.

Which brings to mind this brilliantly appropriate quote by Michael O. Leavitt, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007:

""Everything we do before a pandemic will seem alarmist. Everything we do after a pandemic will seem inadequate. This is the dilemma we face, but it should not stop us from doing what we can to prepare. We need to reach out to everyone with words that inform, but not inflame. We need to encourage everyone to prepare, but not panic.""

Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. In this global healthcare crisis and the ultimate test of our times, it is on all of us to be responsible.

Dismissed, just like that, because she was young, and because she was a woman.

A proper listen to her symptoms revealed that this could indeed, be cardiac. She was admitted, her troponins were raised, a coronary angiography done a few hours later showed an occluded principal obtuse marginal branch which was stented. She was symptom-free the same day.

Fortunately for her, a definitive culprit lesion in her coronaries could be identified, that was amenable to stenting and thus treated. For the majority of women with non-obstructive coronaries, presenting with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA)
1
or ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA), investigations would very likely have stopped right there, with that normal coronary angiography.
Dismissed.

CVD in women

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of mortality among women across the globe.
2
Despite improved treatment algorithms and the enormous strides made in cardiovascular care, women continue to have worse clinical outcomes than men, partly owing to them being underdiagnosed, understudied and undertreated.

One size does not fit all: A spectrum of differences

The inherent biological differences between men and women, in addition to the socio-cultural attributes of gender, mean that women have very different characteristics of ischemia in terms of symptoms, triggers, and aetiologies.

Symptoms:
While chest pain is the predominant presenting symptom in both men and women in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), historically, women have been known to present with more
""atypical""
symptoms such as neck pain, fatigue, dyspnea or nausea, often triggered by emotional stress but even this time-honored notion has been challenged by a recent study that found that typical symptoms were more common among women and have greater predictive value in women than in men with myocardial infarction.
4

Co-morbidities:
Women with ACS are known to be older, with a clustering of risk factors and greater prevalence of co-morbidities.
3
Particularly, diabetes, smoking and a family history of ischaemic heart disease have been shown to have a stronger impact on event rates among women.
3
Younger women with ACS have been found to have a worse pre-event health status (both physical and mental) in comparison to men.
5

The age paradox:
Premenopausal women are thought to be relatively protected against CVD compared to similar-aged men, owing to favorable effects of estrogen on cardiovascular function and metabolism. Intriguingly though, recent studies report an increase in hospitalization rates of ACS among young women, despite a decline among younger men. The mechanisms behind these differences remain a fairly understudied area.

Delayed presentation:
Women are also known to present later, frequently attributing their symptoms to a non-cardiac-related condition such as acid reflux, stress, or anxiety.
2,3
This inaccurate symptom attribution, in addition to a lack of awareness of risk, and barriers to self-care in general, lead to a delay in seeking treatment, contributing to poorer outcomes.

Different etiologies:
By virtue of an obstructed coronary artery, my patient got lucky in terms of prompt diagnosis and treatment. In about 10% of all patients, and in about a third of women, such a culprit coronary lesion cannot be identified on angiography.
2,3
Furthermore,
microvascular angina
affects close to a half of patients with non-obstructive coronary arteries.
7
This coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is defined as the presence of symptoms and objective evidence of ischemia in absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, with blood flow reserve and/or inducible microvascular spasmAngina with no obstructive coronary arteries is twice as prevalent in women as in men,
7
and might also contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is also more commonly observed in women.
9

Women are still under-studied in clinical trials

In the face of such a formidable gender disparity in CVD, women continue to be under-represented in some areas of cardiovascular clinical trials, particularly in ischaemic heart disease and heart failure drug trials, the most common cardiovascular conditions affecting women. In fact, a number of pivotal cardiovascular drug trials of 2019 had less than a quarter of women enroll.
12-15
Interestingly, the PARAGON-HF trial, where 51.7% of patients were women, found a heterogeneity in treatment response: women with HFpEF responded better to valsartan-sacubitril, with a 28% reduction (rate ratio 0.73) in the primary endpoint.

In a compelling 2018 editorial, doctors Pilote and Raparelli explore the practical reasons for under-enrollment of women in cardiovascular drug trials, notably male-patterned inclusion criteria and gender-related barriers to screening and participation in trials, such as caretaking roles and low socioeconomic status. While proposing interventions to mitigate this issue (childcare and such support for women during time spent as a research participant, inclusion criteria that consider sex differences in pathophysiology, prespecified subgroup analyses, etc.), they warn that such under-representation of women could lead to sex-biased outcome measurements and missed opportunities to transfer results in clinical practice.

The issue, in essence, is not just about researching CVD in women: even within this large cohort, differences in symptoms, presentation and outcomes, heterogeneity related to age, ethnicity and geographic locations exist. Why younger women with ACS tend to have unfavorable prognoses is an as-yet unanswered question, with huge scope for research, as is microvascular dysfunction, known to be more prevalent among women.

What can be done?

With February being national heart month, and the American Heart Association's #GoRedForWomen campaign soaring at its highest, it seems like a good time to reflect on what can (and should) be done for women with CVD. Because there is plenty left to do.

Raise awareness:
It's vital that both women and men are aware that heart disease is as big a killer in women as in men. The AHA's signature women's initiative Go Red for Women (
https://www.goredforwomen.org/
) and the sub-initiatives of Wear Red Day are great platforms dedicated to increase women's heart health awareness. The Women's Heart Alliance (
https://www.womensheartalliance.org/
) is another organization working to promote gender equity in research, prevention, awareness and treatment.

Enroll more women in clinical trials:
it's important to identify barriers accounting for the low inclusion of women in clinical trials, and actively intervene to overcome them.

Women's Heart Health Clinic:
a number of programs have successfully initiated women's heart health clinics, exclusively catering to the diagnosis and treatment of this often-underestimated patient group.

Get more women involved:
at every level, be it as clinical trialists, advocates, physicians, nurses or other health-care providers.

As physicians, perhaps the best thing we can do for our female patients is to pay more attention. Don't dismiss a symptom, because nothing should ""not seem cardiac"" until proven otherwise.

So, yes:

Listen to
her
.

Diagnose
her
.

Investigate
her
.

Study
her
.

Treat
her
.

And don't just #GoRedForWomen in February. #GoRedForWomen throughout the year.

While reflecting on an extraordinarily busy yet rewarding career year of 2019, I thought of my resolutions for 2020. I'm exceptionally bad at keeping new year resolutions, so I only made one: to be happy.

The concept of Ikigai

Happiness can mean different things to different people, and each of us, particularly medical professionals, is on a personal journey. There is a cool Japanese concept that encompasses multiple spheres of happiness, called
Ikigai.
Meaning ""a reason for being"", it is well-depicted at the intersection of a quintessential Venn diagram that is really doing the rounds on the internet.

Image: Find your Ikigai. BODETREE, ADAPTED FROM FRANCESC MIRALLES

Fundamentally, it encompasses aligning one's personal and career goals by combining the things one loves, is good at, what the world needs and what one is/could be paid for.
1
Applied to physicians, it's essentially the pinnacle of work-life balance.

While much is being discussed about physician wellness and work-life balance in recent times, for fellows in training and early career physicians, achieving a good work-life balance can be formidably challenging. In a formative and critical stage in your career, you want to maximize on all opportunities to learn and demonstrate competence. Given that conventional wisdom in medicine has always assumed that working harder and taking on more responsibilities is what makes one a better physician, you find yourself in a precarious position, and unable to say no, perhaps to avoid being considered ""irresponsible"" or ""disinterested"", among others.

Thus ""having it all"" is way easier said than done. Thinking long and hard about this resolution, I went back to the concept of
Ikigai.
Seemingly, in order to discover your Ikigai, you must first find what you're most passionate about, then find the medium through which you can express that passion.
2

As cardiologists, or in fact medical professionals in general, I'd like to think that we're already halfway there, having discovered our passion for the work we do. This got me thinking that a great part of my sense of happiness and fulfillment, my
ikigai
, could actually be achieved simply by getting better, more competent and efficient at my job, thus paving the way (and time) for doing the other things I also wanted to do.

While cardiology can be one of the most rewarding and emotionally fulfilling careers, it does come with significant sacrifices. In my sometimes unrealistic attempts to maintain a social life and achieve the so-called ""work-life balance"", I recall doing exam revisions with my study buddy until midnight, forcibly satisfying a respectable quota of daily reading and ""rewarding"" myself with a game of
Settlers of Catan
with my non-doctor friends late into the night, only to have to be present at rounds by eight the next morning. Especially during my initial years of training, in a pursuit to achieve work-life balance, I struggled trying to exclusively ""slot out"" time periods for work and leisure. As a result, my laptop became a mandatory accessory, finding a place at hangouts, parties and even vacations, where I'd squeeze in that little bit of work if I found the time.

P-squared: Matching passion with purpose

So, how do you effectively ensure time for other things in life, without compromising on expectations and quality at work? I found myself picking up handy tips from Morton T. Hansen's fabulous book
Great at Work: The hidden habits of top performers.
3
One aspect that really resonated with me was the concept of
P-squared
, i.e. matching passion with a strong sense of purpose. He writes about how passion at work is not merely taking pleasure in the work itself, but can come from success, social interactions, learning and competence. In short, pursuing activities that are
personally meaningful
.

Working
smarter
over working harder

One way of ensuring one's focus on meaningful activities is to prioritize and decide what work you will pour your heart and soul into.
3
Naturally, each task is not guaranteed to trigger your interest to the maximum. While the ""chores"" that are one's professional responsibility absolutely need to be done (and prioritized), it's important to pick and prioritize ancillary projects, thus ensuring one's full focus and ultimately better seeing it to fruition. Given professional hierarchy in medicine, it can sometimes be difficult to say no early on in one's career. A piece of brilliant advice I've been given in such scenarios is: If it's part of a project you happen to land but which can (and should) be done by someone else, delegate it smartly and oversee the work. The advantages are multiple: you facilitate an opportunity for someone else to gain that experience, you gain the experience of overseeing a job and most importantly, it reduces an unnecessary load on you, allowing you to make the time for the projects that matter.

Also, focusing on doing fewer things but doing them better, means that you have more time left over, which you can spend on your private life, effecting towards some degree of work-life balance.
3

Share the load

A roster has a purpose and it's important to share the load. Accepted that we all have our unique personal challenges, some more than others, I found myself chronically covering another person's roster, stressing out and compromising on my own private time that I could very well have spent with family and friends. While mutual cooperation within a working unit is vital to good work-life balance, particularly in medicine, it should certainly not be at the expense of one's happiness.

Take breaks

Doctor Hansen also writes about the importance of keeping one's passion in check, and not allowing it to consume you.
3
Grossly translated, it means making the time for one's private life, be it travel, working out, reading or playing a sport. Thanks to a wonderfully supportive spouse, I might have gotten away with amalgamating work and life on most occasions, but I appreciate the necessity of making an effort to keep work passions in check, and actively make some quality time for family and friends.

""Work on how you work, not on protecting your life from work"" -
Morten T Hansen

All things said, I'm extremely grateful for being able to do something that I absolutely love, would hope I'm good at (!), get paid for and certainly what the world needs, neatly satisfying the central convergence of the multiple dimensions
ikigai.
One's
ikigai.
is a deeply personal journey, and not one a mentor can spell out for you. However, actively making an effort to being efficient at work, being less stressed out and more balanced would certainly make one better at life too, translating to happier social and private lives. Achieving an Utopian level of work-life balance may not be possible, but finding happiness and fulfillment in what you do certainly is, and it's a resolution I'm going to make an effort to keep this year. A happy new year to you all!

The recently concluded AHA Scientific Sessions provided for a myriad of sessions on antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The late-breaking TWILIGHT ACS trial reported a win for ticagrelor monotherapy among patients randomized after 3 months post-NSTE-ACS and PCI, in results consistent with the main TWILIGHT trial.
1-2
TWILIGHT ACS showed a reduction of clinically significant bleeding with no increased risk of ischemic adverse events at 1 year, for those randomized to ticagrelor monotherapy versus aspirin plus ticagrelor (DAPT).
1

That same day, an entire session aptly titled ""Aspirin: who needs it anymore?"" dedicated to the dissection of aspirin, featured a series of talks on the role for aspirin for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Nevertheless, while aspirin may still remain in the game with respect to secondary prevention, 3 randomized clinical trials in primary prevention have ensured a ""three strikes and you're out"" scenario for aspirin, culminating in a de-emphasis in the guidelines as well.

One of the best things about attending meetings is the effortless re-cap/ additional reading one does afterwards. Thus, in order to discern how such a fate befell aspirin, here's a brief look at the ""three A's"" of 2018 responsible for hitting the nail in the coffin:

The ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risks of Initial Vascular Events) trial

ARRIVE enrolled 12 546 patients (men >= 55 years with 2-4 risk factors and women >= 60 years with >=risk factors for CVD) who were randomized to enteric-coated (EC) aspirin 100 mg/day versus placebo.
3 ~
29*5% of participants were women. Individuals with diabetes and those at high risk of bleeding were excluded. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, unstable angina, stroke, or transient ischemic attack.

After a median follow-up of 5 years, no significant differences were observed in the primary end-point between those assigned to aspirin vs placebo (4.29% vs 4.48%; p=0.6038), although the event rate was much lower than expected, thus making the study more representative of a low-risk population. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, however, there were significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding events (predominantly mild) in the aspirin group than placebo (0.97% vs 0.46%; p=0*0007).

The ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial

This trial enrolled 19,114 healthy community-dwelling individuals across sites in Australia and the USA aged >= 70 years (or >= 65 years if Black/ Hispanic in US) and devoid of CVD, dementia or disability who were randomized to 100 mg EC aspirin vs placebo.
4-6

The primary end-point was a composite of death, dementia or persistent physical disability while secondary end points included major hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease (defined as any ischaemic event).
4-6
At 56.4%, ASPREE enrolled the highest number of women from among the three trials.
4
The median age of participants was 74 years.

The trial was terminated early at a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, as it was determined that no benefit would be derived with continued aspirin use in terms of primary end point. Accordingly, there were no significant differences in the primary composite outcomes (21.5 vs. 21.2 events per 1000 person-years; p = 0.79 ).
4
However, rates of major bleeding were significantly higher in the aspirin group (8.6 vs. 6.2 events per 1000 person-years; p < 0.001), with a progressive increase in the cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage across the follow-up period.
5
The majority of these episodes were gastrointestinal bleeds, with the higher risk of upper GI bleeds being particularly more pronounced with aspirin (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.66).
5

There was also an increased risk of all-cause mortality in the aspirin group versus placebo (12.7 vs 11.1 events per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29) with cancer being the major contributor to the higher mortality seen with aspirin.
6
Thus, ASPREE concluded that the daily use of low-dose aspirin did not prolong disability-free survival among the elderly.
6

The ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) trial

A trial specifically designed to investigate the effects of aspirin in primary prevention among diabetics, ASCEND enrolled 15,480 individuals (~37. 5% women) in the United Kingdom with diabetes but no evident CVD who were randomized to 100 mg of aspirin daily versus placebo.
7

During a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, those randomized to aspirin had a significantly lower percentage of serious vascular events in comparison to placebo (8.5% vs. 9.6%; P=0.01). However, this benefit was offset by significantly higher major bleeding events seen in the aspirin arm (4.1% vs. 3.2%, p=0.003), with no attenuation of the effect on bleeding over time. As with ARRIVE, the majority (41.3%) of major bleeding events were gastrointestinal, of which close to two thirds were in the upper GI tract. Thus, the trial concluded that the absolute benefits of aspirin in preventing CVD among diabetics were largely counterbalanced by the hazards of bleeding.

These trials formed the basis for the de-emphasis of aspirin in the 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, which recommended against the prophylactic use of aspirin among elderly (>70 years) and those at high bleeding risk. There was also a downgrade in class of recommendation for low dose aspirin for primary prevention in select 40 to 70 year-old adults at higher ASCVD risk but lower bleeding risk (Class II b).
8

To add to this, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 13 trials comprising of 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease by Zheng et al., found that aspirin use was associated with a significant reduction of cardiovascular events but also an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin.
9

As Dr Erin Michos, one of the co-authors of the Primary Prevention guidelines pointed out in her talk at AHA 2019, this poor performance of aspirin in terms of risk-benefit could be attributed to the improved adherence to other primary prevention methods, such a reduction of smoking, better control of blood pressure and importantly more aggressive lipids control by virtue of statins.

With the much-needed emphasis on bleeding and its detrimental effects, ""less is more"" has been the focus in recent times, at least for antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs, with recognition of trials that withdraw rather than add to current drug treatments. Furthermore, the appropriate prescription of drugs and increased emphasis on lifestyle modification for primary prevention cannot be understated. The onus is on physicians to keep up to date and tailor drug prescriptions to the individual patient.

Also, in keeping with the spirit of on post-conference re-caps, highly recommend the following as additional reading:

Approximately 30-40% of AHA Scientific session attendees are from outside of the United States. Taking a couple (or more!) of flights, landing in a new city after a 23-hour trip from across the Atlantic and functioning at optimum levels during a meeting of such magnitude may well be a formidable task, particularly when it's a short trip and you want to get the most of it.

While each person has their own mechanisms of adapting, here's some derived from my relatively short experience:

Optimize the long flight hours:
I personally feel that sleep makes for the finest use of flight time, particularly on long-haul flights and red-eyes. There are others, however, who might opt to use this time to fine-tune presentations and prepare points for posters. A good rest in flight also helps you adapt and combat jetlag optimally, allowing you to function at maximum efficiency.

Get the mundane things over with
: Make sure you've sorted (and preferably pre-paid for) accommodation, figured out airport to hotel commutes, activated international roaming allowing for sufficient data/connectivity and downloaded offline maps of the city, just in case. Accommodation within walking distance to meeting location is convenient, allowing for a later wake-up (if you're not an early riser like yours truly!) but most importantly obviating the need for figuring out taxis/ tube maps/traffic navigation when you're very likely to be in a rush.

Pack light but pack smart:
International transfers can be unpredictable; I always factor in lost/delayed bags and pack an entire day's conference wardrobe into my hand luggage. The importance of comfortable shoes cannot be understated, especially if you're trying to do a superspeed
Flash
act between meeting rooms. I also carry a large bag at meetings, one that would accommodate a fully-charged laptop and power banks, phone charger with universal adapter (absolute essential!) and a light jacket for a cold meeting room. Also, any additional space is more than welcome for journals and other print material you might pick up.

Plan your itinerary right:
Basically, be in the room where it happens. Even with the most efficient meeting app, chances are you'll have multiple overlapping sessions bookmarked. Keeping in mind the genre of sessions one might not always have access to back home, I would opt to attend late-breaking science, live cases and interactive sessions by experts, over, say, seminars and updates on more general topics.

Use social media:
It's a formidable accessory to derive the maximum conference experience. Apart from the obvious pluses of rapid access to scientific content and networking, a twitter update might even alert you to a session you intended on attending but somehow missed bookmarking.

Avail opportunities for networking:
Most of conference science can now be accessed online post-conference but, one cannot put a price to the value of face-to-face networking or comparing notes with peers from across the globe, potentially even leading to collaborations. And let's not forget the opportunities to literally pick on the brains of global experts at dedicated sessions, such as those offered at the FIT lounge.

It's not all about the science:
Make use of the additional programming. The Women in Science mentor-mentee session I had Saturday morning with Dr Noel Bairey Merz, even before I attended my first scientific session, provided a wonderful opportunity to discuss research and career with a prominent woman in cardiology (WIC).

Take breaks:
Go to exhibition halls and training pavilions; If you're super-saturated with all the scientific content, visiting booths at exhibit halls are actually a great way to take a breather, caffeinate, pick-up some new literature or check out the new tech.

Get involved:
At various levels in one's career, there are many ways international members can get involved, perhaps by joining one of the AHA's 16 scientific councils, for a start. The Early Career Blogging program is a fantastic project: apart from the remarkable learning and networking opportunities it affords, you can't beat the incredible perks of front row seats at the Presidential Session, including a performance by the cast of Hamilton!!

Embrace the different perspectives but apply them locally:
While these meetings provide the international attendee a much-needed global perspective on a variety of aspects pertaining to cardiology, it's also equally important to appropriately apply what you learn, taking into account local culture and tailoring it to the norms of practice back home.

Enjoy the break from work
: Last but not least, even with the busiest of itineraries, international meetings offer what can sometimes be much-needed downtime and a break from work. There is no joy like that of exploring a new city, so even if it means taking an extra half day, use that ""me"" time to good effect. Carpe diem!

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in an overwhelming surge in utilization of healthcare resources. The effect on hospitals is incontrovertible but the effect on outpatient services is less well-studied. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, and headache and may mimic other common upper respiratory infections [

]. Patients with these symptoms are likely to present to outpatient providers. In most patients, symptoms will be mild to moderate, where management for mild symptoms does not require hospitalization [

]. Recently, evidence for D-dimer cutoff values that predict high-risk for VTE has been demonstrated and the presence of VTE has been shown to be a poor prognostic indicator in severe COVID-19 patients [

]. The extent to which the risk of hypercoagulability exists in the outpatient setting is unknown but has serious implications for outpatient and primary care providers (PCP).

In the inpatient setting, patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections leading to pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure demonstrate elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen, evidencing a hypercoagulable state [

]. The underlying pathophysiology contributing to the hypercoagulable state may be related to cytokine storm inducing endothelial damage, microvascular thrombosis, and/or to the development of prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies [

The pathophysiologic differences between patients with severe and mild disease is currently being studied, however patients with mild disease demonstrate decreased lymphocyte count with increases in plasma IL-6 concentrations, suggesting the presence of an activated underlying inflammatory cascade [

]. Comparable to hospitalized patients, this proinflammatory state may predispose outpatients to the development of VTE and portend a worse outcome. Prior studies have demonstrated an association between pro-inflammatory cytokines and onset of VTE [

]. Moreover, studies of outpatients with VTE demonstrated that about 1/5 of patients had a recent infection, suggesting the recent setting of inflammation from infection may contribute to VTE risk. It stands to reason that viral infection from COVID-19, which has demonstrated remarkable elevations in hematological markers of coagulation [

]. Specific regimens of extended thromboprophylaxis may include betrixaban 160 mg on day 1, followed by 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days; rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 31-39 days; or aspirin in lower-risk patients, as recommended by American Society of Hematology [

]. The question of whether non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients should receive VTE prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation remains to be elucidated. Similarly, the role of anti-platelet therapy in this setting has not been studied. In this time of uncertainty, providers should follow guidelines put forth by the CDC and other governing medical associations as well as integrate up-to-date data from ongoing clinical trials into daily practice. Laboratory evaluation of proinflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin as well as assessment of coagulation with D-dimer, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time (PT) in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 are being used in the inpatient setting, but their prognostic utility for VTE risk in outpatients have not been studied. In the outpatient setting, as many providers follow patients through telehealth to minimize transmission, the index of suspicion for VTE in patients presenting with symptoms typical of deep-venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli should remain high [

]. In patients without signs of VTE, close observation via telehealth for patients may be appropriate, as many are encouraged to self-isolate. VTE prophylactic strategies such as frequent mobilization are not known to be effective in patients with COVID-19, but may be reasonable in patients who have mild disease, are functionally able to perform instrumental activities of daily living, and are confined at home during this time. In high-risk patients, such as those with a history of malignancy or prior VTE, recent guidelines suggest the consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation with standard dosing [

] can aid in the consideration of anti-coagulation therapy. While elderly patients are at greater risk for severe COVID-19, clinical judgement for further anti-coagulation for those already on anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy must consider bleeding risk factors [

]. Providers may also counsel patients to consider stopping pro-thrombotic medications such as selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors or supplements such as vitamin K or vitamin E. Studies evaluating any benefit versus perceived harm from standard NSAIDS are ongoing.

With the global burden of COVID-19 mortality reaching over 300,000 deaths worldwide, little is known about the specific pathogenic viral features and poor outcomes in these patients. A recent prospective study of autopsy findings from consecutive deaths from COVID-19 found thromboembolic events to be a common cause of mortality, with only a small proportion of patients characterized from the outpatient setting [

]. In the case of patients with mild symptoms from coronavirus, risk factors should be integrated with laboratory data and emerging guidelines to mitigate the risks of thromboembolism. Further investigations from the outpatient setting of COVID-19 are warranted with high priority, as the global impact of optimizing risk-management in these patients extends far beyond VTE prevention alone.

Aims

We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.

Results

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted."

Abstract

Background and aims

Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""diabetes"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""SARS"", ""infection"" and ""management of diabetes mellitus"" with interposition of the Boolean operator ""AND"".

Results

Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct b-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.

Conclusions

The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic."

Latest evidences from literature suggest that SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy and that disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in the majority of deceased patients. Particularly, conventional coagulation parameters appear to be significantly altered in patients with poor prognosis. A wide-ranging cross- talk between coagulative haemostasis and inflammation, as well as the activation of coagulation cascade during viral infections, are well established. Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia. Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improve the clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer. In this context, further studies are needed to optimise the decision making in therapeutic approach."

Abstract

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be responsible for a cluster of acute atypical respiratory pneumonia cases in Wuhan, in Hubei province, China. The disease caused by this virus is called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The virus is transmitted between humans and the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19 due to inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation, endothelial damage and diffuse intravascular coagulation. However, the data on this topic are still limited. Here we report the case of a man presenting with pneumonia complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolism."

Abstract

INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) is the single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
1
Although not fully studied, the predominant routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact.
1
SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan in early December 2019 and spread rapidly and globally within the next few months.
1
This led to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 after more than 118,000 cases were reported. These cases have only increased since then without any sign of declining as of April 13, 2020.
2,3

Cutaneous manifestations have been reported in COVID-19 patients, which is unsurprising given the established connection between exanthems and viral infections, including those witnessed in SARS-CoV patients occasionally during the 2003 SARS epidemic.
4,5
Many reports detail generalized sporadic erythematous exanthems along the trunk or the extremities that resolve spontaneously within days without treatment.
1,4,6,7
Some may have additional clinical features such as petechiae as reported by Joob and colleagues. Few cases have reported on generalized urticaria.
8,9
Recalcati and colleagues also report one patient that developed a vesicular eruption mimicking varicella.
4
Disease severity did not correlate with these exanthems. Lastly, several critically ill COVID-19 patients have been reported to have vasculopathic presentations, including ischemia of the lower extremities and acral regions associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.
10-13
Ma and colleagues treated dry gangrene of right index finger associated with antiphospholipid syndrome with multiple series of plasma exchange to lower antiphospholipid antibodies.
11
Zhang and colleagues report seven COVID-19 patients had acro-ischemia in the ICU with presentations of cyanotic digits, skin bulla, and dry gangrene.
13
These patients interestingly had elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation product and were treated with low dose heparin. Four of these patients developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and five died from acro-ischemia within a median time of 12 days.

Like other viral infections, exanthems appear as an immune hypersensitivity response to the viral DNA or RNA.
14
These viral exanthems are typically transient and resolve on their own. Generally, respiratory viruses produce diffuse morbilliform or erythematovesicular eruptions.
14
These eruptions may be pruritic and petechial.
6,9
SARS-CoV-2 may trigger antiphospholipid syndrome, and infect endothelial cells, leading to DIC, and thrombosis.
10
This has been shown in COVID-19 patients that had severe thrombosis associated with high titer antibodies for anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-b2 glycoprotein-I, and elevated D-dimer.
9,10
SARS-CoV-2 can also activate lymphocytes to instigate cytokine storms, which can create systemic inflammation and vasculitis that may produce painful acrosyndromes.
10
Coagulopathy and vasculitis can cause local ischemia, leading to ulcer or gangrene formation, and death.

In conclusion, we report that the erythematous exanthems, such as the morbilliform eruption, are not novel to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may resolve spontaneously without treatment. However, it is imperative to recognize cutaneous signs of vasculitis or vasculopathy early in suspected COVID-19 patients because these can cause serious complications, such as limb ischemia. Vasculopathy may be a sign of hypercoagulability, which is more prevalent in severely ill COVID-19 patients and should be aggressively managed to prevent limb ischemia, and ultimately death."

Abstract

Patients infected with the new SARS-CoV-2 appear to be associated with higher risk of thromboembolic disease, especially stroke and pulmonary embolism. We report a case of a 79-year-old woman that presented with stroke and was found to have COVID-19 pneumonia and concomitant large burden pulmonary arterial clot.

Background and Purpose:

Emergency measures to treat patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and contain the outbreak is the main priority in each of our hospitals; however, these measures are likely to result in collateral damage among patients with other acute diseases.

Methods:

A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe. To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region.

Results:

Running title: Bleeding Risk in COVID-19
Manuscript type: Commentary
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new, emerging medical challenge worldwide, with
those affected showing a variety of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild
conditions to critical illness. Patients affected by the causative virus - Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - usually experience cough, fever, dyspnoea, myalgia,
less frequently gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations and, rarely, neurological complications.
Coagulopathy is common among those afflicted and appears to be one of the most significant
adverse prognostic signs (1, 2). Coagulopathy results from concomitant activation of
coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, most likely due to a severe pro-inflammatory state (i.e.,
the so-called cytokine storm) and/or by viral sepsis that sometimes leads to consumption of
coagulation factors and decreased platelet count, resulting in thrombohemorrhagic events (3).
In this process, plasmin breaks down fibrin present in plasma and the bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid, as well as potentially other organs, and leading to excess D-dimer/fibrin(ogen)
degradation products (FDP) formation. This may also lead to reduction in platelet count and
increased risk for hemorrhage (4). In a systematic review of 6,892 patients and meta-analysis of
3,496 patients, platelets were low in 22.9%, D-dimer was high in 34.8%; D-dimer was associated
with a severe clinical course with an OR: 4.03, and low platelets with an OR: 1.78 (5). DIC in
COVID-19 is accompanied by a significant decrease of fibrinogen, and a marked increase of FDP
and D-dimer, that are characteristics of DIC with hyperfibrinolysis, whereas the DIC caused by
infection is accompanied by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) release and suppression
of fibrinolysis. Administration of anti-proteases may prove beneficial (6). Elevated D-dimer, and
FDP, often mildly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and mildly decreased platelet count were
also reported as common findings by Tang et al, more common and more profound in severely
affected patients (2). Fibrinogen levels are sometimes lowered, but may instead be elevated,
whilst activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is sometimes prolonged, but may instead be
shortened, with these potentially suggestive of acute phase events (2, 6). Although
hypercoagulability and thrombotic events are common in COVID-19, bleeding may occur at any
time during the course of disease. Several factors make patients with COVID-19 prone to
bleeding, including thrombocytopenia, hyperfibrinolytic state, consumption of coagulation
factors, and thromboprophylaxis administration of anticoagulants A proposed cytokine storm,
prolonged tissue hypoxia, and direct invasion of affected tissues are other possible causes (2, 7,
8). Although thrombosis is relatively well-studied in COVID-19, bleeding and bleeding risk
appear to be the forgotten side of this story, most probably due to the less-fatal consequences;
however, hemorrhagic diatheses represents a significant morbidity and potential cause of
death in COVID-19 in at least in a subset of patients (7, 8).
Thrombocytopenia
In one early study, about one-third and about half of patients developed thrombocytopenia and
increased D-dimer, respectively, while among severely affected patients the rates are around
60% (1). In another recent large-scale retrospective study on 1,476 consecutive patients, about
20% had thrombocytopenia (<150x109 /L) (9). Those who died had a progressive decrease in
platelet count, and when platelet count was lower the risk of death was higher. For example,
the relative risk of death, and the morality rate, were 3.42 (95% CI 2.36-4.96), 9.99 (95% CI
7.16-13.94), and 13.68 (95% CI 9.89-18.92), and 17.5%, 61.2%, and 92.1%, for platelet count of
100-150, 50-100 and 0-50 x109/L, respectively. Of all patients with thrombocytopenia, about
25% were severely ill, with platelet count between 0-50 x109/L (9). These patients are at risk of
bleeding, and most guidelines recommend platelet transfusion when their platelet count is
between < 30-50 x 109/L for bleeders or for those at high risk of bleeding, and < 10 x 109/L,
whether bleeding or not (10, 11). Therapeutic response of platelet replacement is lower in
patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), high-fever, or splenomegaly (10). In
the setting of COVID-19, currently lacking randomized clinical trials (RCTs), there is no definite
guidance on threshold for platelet transfusion.
In a study of 61 severe ICU-treated and 93 severe non-ICU patients, 41% of the former had
severe thrombocytopenia (<50x109/L), 96% of which had fatal consequences. Fatal
consequences were observed in ICU-treated non-survivors with progressively worsening
thrombocytopenia, but this was rarely observed in non-ICU severe cases or ICU-treated
survivors. More than 55% of non-survivors had a platelet count less than <50x109/L, and about
20% of non-survivors had a platelet count less than <10x109/L in the very late stage of the
disease, 2-3 days prior to death. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) significantly
decreased the platelet count in >80% of CRRT treated patients: in about 50% platelet count was
<10x109/L a few days after treatment onset; subsequently bleeding might occur in these
patients. The overall survival rate was about 6% for patients treated with CRRT (12). Among
severely affected ICU-treated patients, those under LMWH therapy had a lower platelet count
than patients not on therapy. ICU-treated patients under LMWH therapy also had a lower
survival rate than those without heparin. Heparin exposure was considered a risk factor for
progression towards mortality in severe COVID-19 (12). In fact the authors found that CRRT,
heparin exposure and significant platelet decrease were risk factors for the severely ill.
Significant heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was observed, both spontaneously and
after heparin exposure, which might contribute to occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia.
Spontaneous HIT may be due to endogenous release of heparin in viral infection (12). Although
the usefulness of heparin-involving anticoagulation therapy in patients with severe COVID-19
was mentioned by Tang et al., the risk of HIT should also be considered in these cases (2, 12).
Critically ill patients with COVID-19 and CRRT have a high mortality rate, mostly due to HIT.
Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring should be carried out to identify those
with a risk of HIT; on these cases, heparin-involved therapy should be avoided or discontinued;
alternative anticoagulants such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended (12).
Bleeding and bleeding risk
Although respiratory failure (70%), multi-organ failure (MOF) (28%), cardiac failure (15%),
hemorrhage (6%), and renal failure (4%) were reported as leading causes of death in COVID-19
(13), a valuable recent prospective study revealed that pulmonary embolism (PE), was the
direct cause of death in four (~33%), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in seven
(58%) (14). In an autopsy report of four patients, one (25%) had large intra-alveolar
hemorrhages and intra-alveolar fibrin cluster formation (15). Another study analyzing mortality
revealed that 1 (~7%) out of 14 patients died due to GI bleeding (16). It is worth noting,
however, that the patient had lymphoma; thus, co-morbidities may represent a part of the risk
profile.
Bleeding, when seen as the first presentation in COVID-19, may lead to misdiagnosis and
inappropriate clinical and laboratory workup for other viral infections like dengue (17). Fatal GI
bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are other reported forms of severe bleeding (18,
19). Although anorexia is the most common digestive finding (up to 50%) in adults, and diarrhea
is most common in both adults and children (up to ~50%) with COVID-19, GI bleeding was
observed with a frequency of 4-13.7%, primarily among severely affected patients, 40% of
whom were stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive (19, 20). It seems that prolonged
hypoxia causes cell necrosis and mucosal injury, leading to ulceration and GI hemorrhage (12).
Focal hemorrhage in the kidney also has been reported (21). Rare cases of COVID-19 with ICH
have been reported, but further studies are required to clarify this finding (18). This
phenomenon could be attributed to the proposed cytokine storm, and even without direct viral
invasion within the intracranial space, could result in breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (7).
A rare case of COVID-19 with Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) that developed a
subarachnoid microhemorrhage, whilst the patient had a platelet count of 2x109/L, has been
reported (22). It seems that pathological immune conditions may be relatively frequent in this
disease. Multiple cerebral infarctions were reported in COVID-19 associated with IgA
antiphospholipid antibodies, although lupus anticoagulant was not present in these patients,
and persistence was not investigated (23). Thus, the association may not in general hold true.
Thus, overall, the above findings demonstrate that hemorrhage and risk of hemorrhage are not
necessarily an infrequent finding in COVID-19, albeit most probably associated to contributing
factors.
Also, due to a high risk of thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) is recommended by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH)
interim guidance for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (24). This recommendation is
based on expert opinion and a few case series. However, others recommend more aggressive
anticoagulant therapy with unfractionated heparin (UFH), potentially accompanied by anti-
thrombin supplementation (25, 26). Others believe that administration of LMWH may increase
the risk of bleeding in special situations, such as those otherwise requiring a more aggressive
anticoagulation, such as pulmonary embolism (PE) that is missed because of primary lung injury
by the virus (26). In Japan, nafamostat mesylate - an inhibitor of plasmin, thrombin, and trypsin
- is used for management of DIC in COVID-19. Unlike heparin, nafamostat mesylate does not
have hemorrhagic side effects, even at high dose. Due to its antifibrinolytic actions, the drug is
useful for management of DIC with increased fibrinolytic activity. Moreover, it seems that
nafamostat mesylate also has anti-viral activity and may potentially be effective in treating DIC
in COVID-19, but its low anticoagulant activity may also be a disadvantage (27). Another study
shows that thrombosis- and bleeding-predicting tools are useful in the management of patients
(28). The study assessed the potential usefulness of Padua prediction score - to predict
thrombosis risk- and the improved bleed risk assessment model - to predict risk of
bleeding - in COVID-19 patients under thromboprophylaxis with UFH and LMWH.
According to the bleeding predicting tool, 9 (6.5%) patients had a high risk of bleeding
(improved score >= 7), 6 of whom (~67%) experienced hemorrhagic events during the course
of thromboprophylaxis, including mild or microscopic hematuria (n: 3), GI bleeding (n: 1),
epistaxis (n: 1), and severe hemothorax (n: 1) (28). More detailed thromboprophylaxis of
patients with COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is outside the scope of this work
and is presented elsewhere (28). Anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated for patients with
active bleeding and for those with a low platelet count (according to ISTH guidance < 25 x109/L)
(17). In COVID-19 patients under treatment with DOACs, the co-administration of antivirals
significantly increased the plasma concentration of DOACs; trough level of DOAC was 6.14 times
higher during hospitalization than before admission. In order to prevent bleeding in such
patients it was suggested that DOACs be withheld during COVID-19 infection (30).
Although clinical presentations in symptomatic children are relatively similar to adults, in severe
cases, septic shock with irreversible bleeding and coagulation dysfunction may occur (31).
Among the newborns of infected mothers, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver
function was observed in two (20%) and GI bleeding in four (40%). Of the first two patients, one
developed refractory shock, MOF, and DIC which led to death in spite of platelet, plasma and
red blood cell transfusions. Another neonate, with GI bleeding and DIC, responded to
intravenous administration of gamma globulin (32).
Conclusion
In conclusion, despite its prevalence, COVID-19 remains a barely-understood disease with a
high rate of heterogeneous and disparate clinical pictures. New presentations may be observed
among affected patients, and healthcare providers should update their knowledge to prevent
severe and fatal consequences arising from insufficient knowledge. Due to a high rate of
coagulopathy among COVID-19 patients, the risk of bleeding should always be considered in
every case, as bleeding, although rare, may be one of the first clinical presentations at time of
diagnosis.

Introduction. The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role.
Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations.
Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data, with hot spots in all five boroughs. Spatial risk did not correspond precisely to population-based rates of positive tests. The strongest univariate association with positive testing rates was the proportion of residents in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of COPD in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). The next strongest association was with the proportion of Black and African American residents, for which there was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7). Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons.
Conclusions. The population and spatial patterns of COVID-19 infections differ by race, age, physical environment and health status. Areas with large proportions of Black/African American residents are at markedly higher risk that is not fully explained by characteristics of the environment and pre-existing conditions in the population.

Abstract:
More than 2.5 million people were affected by COVID-19 and it had caused around 175000
deaths as on April 23, 2020. Currently, no effective treatment option is available for COVID-
19 patients. Even though many drugs have been proposed, none of them showed their efficacy
in clinical trials. In this article, I had focused on the Adrenergic system- RAAS relation in
COVID-19 and proposed a vicious Adrenergic system-RAAS-ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 (ARAS)
loop. Hyperactivation of the ARAS loop may be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism
in COVID-19. I had proposed beta-adrenergic blockers as a potential treatment option for
treating COVID-19. Beta-adrenergic blockers may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry
by decreasing ACE2 receptors expression, and CD147 in various cells in the body. Beta-
adrenergic blockers may decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients by
preventing or reducing the ARDS, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, refractory
hypoxemia, and septic shock complications. Considering potential beneficial effects of beta-
adrenergic blockers in COVID-19, retrospective and prospective clinical trials need to be
conducted to check the validity of the hypothesis and clarify its role in COVID-19. I had also
speculated that beta2-adrenergic agonists use in the nebulizers, and norepinephrine use in the
COVID-19 patients having septic shock may worsen the condition.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, Beta-adrenergic blockers, Septic Shock,
ARDS, pulmonary embolism.
Highlights:
 Adrenergic system by its action on RAAS, ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial
role in COVID-19.
 Hyperactivation of the vicious ARAS loop may be the mechanism behind COVID-19.
 Beta-adrenergic blockers should be used in COVID-19.
 Norepinephrine should not be given for COVID-19 patients.
 Beta-agonists in nebulizer solution should not be given for COVID-19 patients.
Introduction:
COVID-19 has affected people's lives world over, and as on 23 April 2020, 2544792 people
are affected globally and caused 175694 deaths [1]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, belongs to the
beta coronavirus genus. It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor, and binding to ACE2 is
crucial for the cellular entry of SARS-COV-2 [2,3]. It has been proposed recently that CD147
also known as Basigin, maybe another receptor in the host cells that play a role in the SARS-
CoV-2 entry into the cell [4-6].
Clinical features and pathogenesis in COVID-19: Clinical course of COVID-19 patients are
variable - ranging from being asymptomatic to having mild problems like fever, cough, sore
throat, dyspnea, muscle pain, tiredness, loss of taste or smell sensation, etc. [7,8]. Around 15%
of COVID-19 patients exhibit pneumonia, and ~5% progress to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), where the patient may have tachypnoea, decrease oxygen saturation,
decreased partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and lung infiltrates in the X-ray and CT
chest imaging [9]. Laboratory investigations in moderately or severely affected COVID-19
patients showed increased IL-6, D-dimer, CRP, LDH [8]. Severely affected COVID-19 patients
had lymphopenia, and increased cytokines levels (IL-6, IL-1b, TNFa) [9]. Macrophage and
neutrophil damage of alveoli may lead to hyaline membrane formation.
Severe COVID-19 patients having complications like ARDS, respiratory failure, and septic
shock have a high mortality rate [10]. Increased IL-6 is and indicator of poor outcome in
patients with ARDS and Tocilizumab can be used to block the action of IL-6 [9]. It has been
shown that IL-6 is increased in non-survivors [11]. Increased mucus aggregation has been
noticed in the distal airways and alveoli in the postmortem study of COVID-19 patients [12].
It is known that IL-6 plays a key role in the activation of MUC5AC and MUC5B gene
expression and increases the mucus secretion [13]. It has been suggested that Tocilizumab by
the inhibition of IL-6R may help decrease the mucus secretion in COVID-19[14]. Postmortem
study had also shown the presence of hyperplasia of type II alveolar epithelial cells, diffuse
alveolar damage, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, fibrosis, hyaline membrane formation
[15].
It is known that cytokine storm occurs in COVID-19, as the levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa are
increased and this cytokine storm may lead to multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock [9].
Inflammatory responses like macrophage and neutrophil infiltration may lead to alveolar
damage, pulmonary capillary endothelial dysfunction, and the pulmonary capillary leak that
may lead to pulmonary edema. Since type II pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells are the main
cells that express ACE2 receptors, their damage might cause problems in surfactant secretion
by these cells. Decreased surfactant leads to increased surface tension in the alveoli, which
along with the damage in the alveolar epithelium and pulmonary capillary endothelium, may
lead to pulmonary edema. Respiratory dysfunction as a result of this leads to decreased PaO2,
decreased oxygen saturation, and severe cases were put on mechanical ventilation. If refractory
hypoxemia develops irrespective of mechanical ventilation, then extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) can be tried as per WHO interim guidance [16].
Around 30% of the severely affected COVID-19 patients developed pulmonary embolism in
COVID-19 and d-dimer level is found higher in these patients [17-19]. Around 5% of the
COVID-19 patients have severe complications like ARDS, septic shock [20]. Septic shock
occurs in severely affected COVID-19 patients. In septic shock state, mean arterial pressure is
low (<65mmHg) irrespective of fluid management, and plasma lactate concentration will be
>2mM/L. Septic shock state carries a high mortality rate. The primary drug used in septic shock
is Norepinephrine [21].
In COVID-19, cytokine storm and hyper-inflammation occur irrespective of lymphopenia
[22,23]. Considering the cytokine storm and potential activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
it is likely that immune hyperactivation occurs in COVID-19. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-
CoV has been shown to increase IL-6 via the activation of NFkB [24]. Since the nucleocapsid
protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 89.6% homology with SARS-CoV nucleocapsid [25], it is
likely that the increase in IL-6 found in severely affected COVID-19 patients also may have a
similar underlying mechanism. IL-6 level has been shown to positively correlate with the
SARS-CoV-2 viral load [26]. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3
(NLRP3) inflammasome has been suggested to be activated by SARS-CoV-2. It is known that
Colchicine inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome, and clinical trials have been already registered to
test whether colchicine treatment in COVID-19 improves the clinical condition by inhibiting
NLRP3 [27]. It is known that the SARS-COV orf3a protein activates the NLRP3 [28]. SARS-
CoV viroporin 3a has also been shown to activate NLRP3 [29]. SARS-CoV-2 may also activate
NLRP3 by a similar mechanism. NLRP3 downstream effectors are caspase 1, IL-1b, IL-18
[30]. It is known that the decrease in surfactant protein D in ARDS patients associated with
mortality [31]. Surfactant protein D has been shown to inhibit NLRP3 [32]. Since the type 2
alveolar epithelial cells which secrete the surfactant are one of the main cells affected by SARS-
CoV-2, surfactant secretion may likely be decreased. Reduction in surfactant D may result in
loss of its inhibitory role on NLRP3. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway may
produce an inflammatory response in COVID-19, and as said earlier few trials targetting
NLRP3 have been already started.
Hypercoagulation state in COVID-19: As mentioned earlier, severely affected COVID-19
patients developed pulmonary embolism and d-dimer levels were shown to be high [17-19].
But so far, it is not known what causes pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
in COVID-19. I hypothesize that the hypercoagulation state in COVID-19 may be due to a
sympathetic storm. Increased catecholamine levels may hyperactivate the vicious ARAS loop,
which will be explained in a later section. It has been known that beta2-adrenergic agonist
nebulization increases the plasma catecholamine level [33]. Sympathetic hyperactivation has
been shown to be related to hypercoagulation state [34]. Inhalation of beta2-adrenergic agonists
has been shown to increase factor VIII, vWF, d-Dimer, and lead to hypercoagulation state [35].
I suggest that use of catecholamines in COVID-19 patients may lead to hypercoagulation state,
and use of beta2-adrenergic agonists nebulization for respiratory illness and intravenous
administration of Norepinephrine for treating septic shock should be avoided in COVID-19, as
it may lead to hypercoagulation state and may induce complications like deep vein thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism.
Other organ damage in COVID-19 is not discussed in this article due to space constraints.
Current treatment recommendations and controversies:
At present, there is no effective drug available against the present coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic [8,36,37]. Many potential treatments were proposed and some are on
clinical trials. Many were focusing on drugs that interrupt the binding of spike protein with the
ACE2 receptor, which will be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir,
Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Tozulisumab are used in COVID-19 condition all over
the world, irrespective of the lack of evidence for efficacy so far. Remdesivir by its inhibitory
action on RNA dependent RNA polymerase restricts the viral replication is thought to work,
but so far its efficacy has not been shown in clinical trials [36]. Hydroxychloroquine may
restrict the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry but its efficacy has not been shown in clinical trials so
far. Tozulisumab by its action on the IL-6 receptor blocks the inflammatory actions due to IL-
6, again its efficacy has not been in clinical trials so far. As mentioned earlier, Tocilizumab
may help decrease the mucus secretion in COVID-19 [14]. Currently, NIH did not recommend
the Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Azithromycin, Tozulisumab treatment [37].
Other treatment options on the trial are convalescent plasma therapy. Supportive measures are
used depending on the clinical condition, such as the use of mechanical ventilation, ECMO,
etc. WHO suggests that if refractory hypoxemia persists irrespective of mechanical ventilation
then ECMO can be opted for in selected cases [16]. As said earlier none of them has been
effective in COVID-19 so far. Many had raised concerns about the use of ECMO in COVID-
19, as some studies showed increased mortality in patients who suffered from ARDS and were
on ECMO support [38-40].
In summary, the underlying pathophysiology of the COVID-19 is not known and no effective
treatment is available at present. In this article, I speculate the dangerous relationship between
the adrenergic system, RAAS, ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 condition may be
the underlying pathological mechanism behind COVID-19. I propose the existence of a vicious
Adrenergic system-RAAS-ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 (ARAS) loop in COVID-19 condition. Any
drugs like norepinephrine, beta2 agonist, that increase the activity of ARAS loop, may worsen
the condition in COVID-19 patients. Adrenergic blockers may inhibit this vicious ARAS loop.
I propose beta-adrenergic blockers may be a potential drug option for the treatment of COVID-
19.
Adrenergic system-RAAS-SARS-CoV-2 (ARAS) loop may be the underlying mechanism
behind COVID-19:
It is important to study whether a sympathetic storm occurs in COVID-19. Considering all the
above evidence and clinical features of pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
thrombosis, septic shock it looks like the COVID 19 critical illness may exhibit a sympathetic
storm condition in the body and maybe the basis for all the problem occurring in COVID-19
condition. Increased catecholamine levels in the COVID-19 patients may trigger a hypothetical
ARAS loop. Adrenergic system regulation of RAAS is crucial in the COVID-19 condition.
Increased plasma catecholamine level will activate the adrenergic system, which in turn lead
to the activation of RAAS, and increase in ACE2 as a result of this will increase the SARS-
CoV-2 entry which produces complications in COVID patients, in response to the critical
illness, the endogenous catecholamines will be increased and the vicious cycle goes on. I would
like to call this as Adrenergic system-RAAS-ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 (ARAS) loop (Figure 1).
Critical illness conditions will increase the plasma catecholamine level [41]. It is interesting to
note that adenoviral respiratory illness caused increased plasma catecholamine levels. SARS-
CoV-2 infection may also lead to increased catecholamine levels [42]. I speculate that in the
severely affected COVID-19 patients with complications like ARDS, Septic shock, it is likely
that endogenous catecholamine levels may be high and it may trigger the ARAS loop. Apart
from the increased endogenous catecholamine level in these complicated COVID-19 patients,
giving exogenous catecholamines like beta-agonists in the nebulizer solution for treating
dyspnea or norepinephrine given intravenously for the patients having septic shock, may
further increase the catecholamine level, and hyperactivate the vicious ARAS loop and worsen
the condition. I speculate that any drug that augments the activation of the ARAS loop will
worsen the COVID-19 condition and increase the mortality. The potential dangers of using
norepinephrine, beta2-agonists, and ARBs in COVID-19 are discussed in a later section.
ARB problem and RAAS inhibitors: It is known that the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone
System (RAAS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure, sodium level,
extracellular fluid volume, etc. RAAS system has two opposing arms, the classic Renin-
Angiotensin I- Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-Angiotensin II(ATII)-Aldosterone and
Renin-ATII-Angiotensin-converting-enzyme2(ACE2)-Angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas-receptor
(MasR). Along with the classic pathway which produces effects like vasoconstriction and
inflammation, one more pathway with opposing actions to classic pathway exist which
produces effects like vasorelaxation and it is anti-inflammatory. Unlike the classic RAAS
pathway which uses ACE, the vasorelaxation arm uses ACE2 [43]. Recently concerns were
raised regarding the use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs as it may increase the
ACE2 expression, which in turn may increase the SARS-CoV-2 entry [44,45]. It has been
suggested that other antihypertensive drugs like beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel
blockers can be used in COVID-19 cases with hypertension comorbidity instead of ARBs [44].
On the contrary, many opined that without sufficient evidence there is no need to change the
drugs like ARBs in the COVID-19 patients who are already taking it, and many cardiovascular
societies had issued a notice regarding this issue [46,47]. Withdrawal of angiotensin receptor-
blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19
patients with hypertension comorbidity was suggested not to be done without sufficient
evidence [48]. I suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers decrease the renin level by its inhibitory
action on the sympathetic system and decrease ATII. Unlike ARBs and ACEIs, beta-adrenergic
blockers have an advantage by its action on upstream protein renin, which may decrease the
activity of both arms. Thereby, beta-adrenergic blockers not only decrease ATII levels but also
reduce the ACE2 receptors, which will be useful in regulating the blood pressure and at the
same time decreases the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. I suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers
can be considered as an alternative to ARBs in the COVID-19 patients having hypertension
co-morbidity and ARBs should be avoided in COVID-19 patients. Since ARBs by blocking
the angiotensin II receptor will increase the ATII level, it may trigger the ARAS loop and
complicate the COVID-19 condition. It has been already shown that angiotensin II induces
pulmonary edema in the animal model study [49], which supports the view that increased ATII
may be detrimental in COVID-19.
Beta2-adrenergic agonist nebulizer solution problem: Clinicians used to treat dyspnoeic
patients routinely with beta2-adrenergic agonists like salbutamol, anticholinergics, and
corticosteroids either alone or in combinations. Beta2-adrenergic agonists are one of the
primary drugs used in nebulizers, considering its role in sympathetic activation and renin
release, beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase ACE2 expression in the alveolar epithelial
cells which may help the SARS-CoV-2 and worsen the condition. It has been already suggested
that beta-2 agonists should be avoided in ARDS, as it worsens the condition [50]. Irrespective
of it, still beta2-adrenergic agonists are given by many for ARDS. As mentioned earlier, beta2-
adrenergic agonists like salbutamol used in the nebulizer solutions, increased the plasma
catecholamine level, and produced hypercoagulable state [33-35]. Considering the vicious
ARAS loop, I suggest beta2-adrenergic agonists should be avoided in the nebulizer solutions,
as it will worsen the clinical condition in COVID-19 patients and may produce complications
like pulmonary embolism.
Norepinephrine problem in COVID-19: Adrenergic system hyperactivation occurs in critical
conditions, which increases the catecholamine level. Critically ill COVID-19 patients may also
have sympathetic storm condition i.e. increased catecholamine level in the body. So far whether
increased catecholamine level occurs in COVID-19 patients is not known, but since any critical
condition may increase the adrenergic system, it is likely that in severe COVID-19 patients
catecholamine levels may increase. Increased catecholamine levels will lead to increase renin
release, which increases the activity of its both arm including an increase in ACE2 expression,
which may help the SARS-Cov-2 cellular entry and worsen the condition. Some of the severe
COVID-19 patients may end up in septic shock, where the mean arterial pressure (MAP) will
be lower than 65mmHg irrespective of fluid resuscitation, and plasma lactate will be more than
2mM/L. The primary drug used in septic shock is Norepinephrine [21]. As mentioned earlier,
in the critical COVID-19 patients, endogenous catecholamine levels may be increased, and
giving the norepinephrine exogenously will further worsen the condition. Many had raised
concerns about the use of norepinephrine in septic shock, as norepinephrine may worsen the
condition and increase the mortality rate in septic shock [51-54]. Not only increased
catecholamine but increased RAAS activation also is detrimental in sepsis patients, it has been
shown that increased AT II, plasma renin activity worsens the sepsis condition [55]. Recent
studies showed that beta-adrenergic blockers may be beneficial in septic shock [56,57]. I
suggest that Norepinephrine should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients having
septic shock, instead beta-adrenergic blockers should be used in the treatment of septic shock
in COVID-19 patients.
Adrenergic hyperactivation may produce pulmonary edema: As mentioned earlier,
increased catecholamine levels may trigger the ARAS loop and worsen the COVID-19. It is
well known that increased catecholamine induces pulmonary edema. Studies had shown that
both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors may be involved in this. Both alpha1 and beta-
adrenergic blockers have shown to relieve pulmonary edema in many animal models studies.
Due to adrenergic receptor involvement in the etiology of pulmonary edema, it has been
suggested that beta-2 agonists should not be used routinely in the mechanically ventilated
patients [58]. As mentioned earlier, increased catecholamine levels may induce pulmonary
edema and it can be prevented by adrenergic receptor blockers. I suggest beta-adrenergic
blockers like Propranolol or alpha1 adrenergic blockers like Prazosin should be used to reduce
or prevent pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients.
Beta-adrenergic blockers may reduce or prevent pulmonary embolism in COVID-19
patients: As mentioned earlier, severely affected COVID-19 patients developed pulmonary
embolism in COVID-19 and d-dimer level were shown to be high [17-19]. This indicates that
the hypercoagulation state occurs in COVID-19. As mentioned earlier, adrenergic
hyperactivation is associated with the hypercoagulation state. It is known that beta-blockers
reduce the coagulation parameters and prevent complications like venous thrombosis in both
animal models and patients [59,60]. I suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers should be used in
COVID-19 patients to prevent or reduce the hypercoagulation state complications like
pulmonary embolism complication and deep vein thrombosis.
Beta-adrenergic blockers treatment in COVID-19 (Figure 2): Considering the above
details, beta-adrenergic blockers like Propranolol should be used in COVID-19 patients. In this
article, I had focused mainly on the beta-adrenergic blocker's role in COVID-19. Which
subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor blocker plays a crucial role in COVID-19 remains to be
seen in the future. It is also possible that alpha1 adrenergic blockers like Prazosin or
combination of beta- and alpha-adrenergic blockers may also be beneficial in COVID-19. I had
discussed the advantages of using beta-adrenergic blockers in COVID-19 in the following
section.
Twelve reasons that indicate beta-adrenergic blockers may be a good candidate for the
treatment of COVID-19 patients:
1. Beta-adrenergic blockers block the entry of SARS-COV-2 via the ACE2 receptor as
well as CD147.
Beta-blockers by its negative regulation on the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney
reduce the activity of both arms of the RAAS pathway, thereby it may decrease the
ACE2 level. As ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, beta-adrenergic
blockers may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. It is already known that beta-
adrenergic blocker propranolol down-regulates CD147 [61]. Therefore, beta-adrenergic
blockers treatment in COVID-19 will decrease the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry by
downregulation of both ACE2 and CD147.
2. It is known that activation of beta-adrenergic receptors plays a role in the IL-6 secretion
[62]. It is also known that beta-adrenergic blockers decrease IL-6 in cardiac disorder
patients [63,64]. I suggest beta-adrenergic blockers will reduce the IL-6 level in
COVID-19 patients and reduce the inflammatory complications associated with it.
3. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to decrease a variety of proinflammatory
cytokines expression including IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, IFNg [63-67]. The use of beta-
adrenergic blockers in COVID-19 patients may reduce the expression of the
proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammation associated with it.
4. Beta-adrenergic blockers may be beneficial in ARDS and respiratory failure condition:
It is known that beta-adrenergic agonists counterintuitively worsen the ARDS condition
and beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to reduce the mortality in ARDS [50].
Noveanu et al had showed based on the BASEL II ICU study that beta-adrenergic
blockers reduce mortality in respiratory failure cases [68]. A recent study has shown
that beta-adrenergic blockers reduce mortality in ARDS [69].
5. Recent trends suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers are beneficial in Septic shock and
reduce the mortality rate [56,57]. As mentioned earlier, many had raised concerns about
the use of norepinephrine in septic shock [51-54]. I suggest that norepinephrine use for
treating septic shock in the COVID-19 condition should be avoided. And beta-
adrenergic blockers should be used for treating septic shock in COVID-19 patients.
6. Beta-adrenergic blockers may reduce the pulmonary edema: As mentioned earlier,
increased catecholamine levels resulted in pulmonary edema in the animal model
studies. And both alpha1-adrenergic blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers are shown
to reduce pulmonary edema and improve the condition [58]. I suggest that beta-
adrenergic blockers may prevent or reduce the pulmonary edema complication in
COVID-19 condition and alpha-1 adrenergic blockers like Prazosin may also be
beneficial in reducing pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients.
7. I suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers may reduce the hypercoagulation state and
decrease the deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism complications in COVID-
19 patients. It is known that beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the coagulation parameters
supports the above claim [59,60].
8. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to improve the oxygenation level in the
patients who were on ECMO [70]. This suggests the possibility that the use of beta-
adrenergic blockers in COVID-19 patients who are on ECMO may improve the
oxygenation level. It has been shown that beta-adrenergic blockers improved the
oxygenation level in the hypoxic condition induced in an animal study [71]. It is known
that beta-adrenergic blockers improve the PaO2 level in critically ill patients and
increase the oxygenation [72,73]. Considering the above evidence, I suggest that beta-
adrenergic blockers may improve the oxygenation level and reduce the hypoxemia in
COVID-19 patients.
9. Beta-adrenergic blockers may reduce the mucus hypersecretion in COVID-19:
Increased mucus aggregation has been noticed in the distal airways and alveoli in the
postmortem study of COVID-19 patients [12]. It is known that IL-6 plays a key role in
the activation of MUC5AC and MUC5B gene expression and increases the mucus
secretion [13]. It has been suggested that Tocilizumab by the inhibition of IL-6 R may
help decrease the mucus secretion in COVID-19 [14]. As mentioned earlier, beta-
adrenergic blockers may decrease IL-6. It is interesting to note that chronic propranolol
administration has been shown to decrease MUC5AC expression and mucus secretion
[74]. I suggest that the use of beta-adrenergic blockers like propranolol may decrease
the mucus secretion and MUC5AC expression in COVID-19 cases.
10. Wu et al using the computational method had shown some potential molecules that
could be used for the treatment in COVID-19. In that article, beta-adrenergic blocker
Oxprenolol has been suggested to potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease
(PLpro) and Carvedilol has been suggested to potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3-
chymotrypsin like protease [75]. Using a network-based approach Zhou et al had shown
16 potential drugs that have the potential to be used in the COVID-19 treatment, and
one of the drugs mentioned was beta-adrenergic blocker Carvedilol [25]. The above
two recent computational studies also support the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic
blockers may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
11. Beta-adrenergic blockers inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome: As mentioned earlier NLRP3
has been suggested to be activated in COVID-19 and few clinical trials like using
Colchicine to inhibit NLRP3 are already registered [27]. It is interesting to note that
beta-adrenergic blocker carvedilol has been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome
[77]. Thus, one of the many uses of beta-adrenergic blockers in the COVID-19
condition may be the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and thereby reducing the
inflammation by decreasing the NLRP3 downstream effectors IL-1 and IL-8.
12. Traditionally clinicians are hesitant in using beta-blockers in patients with respiratory
illness. But recent studies are changing this viewpoint, for example, beta-adrenergic
blockers has been shown beneficial effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) patients [78]. I suggest that clinicians should not hesitate to use beta-adrenergic
blockers in COVID-19 patients having respiratory dysfunction.
Considering the above evidence beta-adrenergic blockers like Propranolol may be a good
candidate for treating COVID-19 patients. As mentioned earlier which subtype of beta-
adrenergic receptor blocker plays a crucial role in COVID-19 needs to be clarified in the
future. It is also possible that alpha1-adrenergic blockers like Prazosin or combination of
beta and alpha-adrenergic blockers may also be beneficial in COVID-19.
Evaluation of the hypothesis:
1. a. To check the presence of the hypothetical ARAS loop, I suggest measuring the
following in COVID-19 patients - plasma catecholamine levels especially plasma
norepinephrine levels, AT II, ACE, ACE2, Renin levels. These parameters need to be
measured in all the COVID-19 patients along with the viral load measurement. If the
above said ARAS loop molecules plasma concentration correlates with the viral load
in the COVID-19, it will validate the existence of the ARAS loop in COVID-19.
b. The plasma catecholamine levels in COVID-19 patients have to be measured in all
the COVID-19 patients which will clarify whether a sympathetic storm occurs in this
condition.
2. I suggest conducting retrospective and prospective clinical trials to clarify the following
questions,
i. Whether beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the morbidity and mortality in
COVID-19 patients?
ii. Whether beta-adrenergic agonists in nebulizer solutions increase the morbidity
and mortality in COVID-19 patients?
iii. Whether Norepinephrine given for COVID-19 patients suffering from septic
shock increases mortality?
iv. Whether the use of ARBs in COVID-19 patients having hypertension
comorbidity increase morbidity and mortality?
Conclusion:
Adrenergic system relation to RAAS and SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in COVID-19. A
hypothetical ARAS loop has been proposed, hyperactivation of the ARAS loop may be the
pathophysiological mechanism behind COVID-19. Beta-adrenergic blockers may produce
beneficial effects in the COVID-19 patients in many ways ranging from decreasing the SARS-
CoV-2 virus entry, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome, reduction of IL-6 to decreasing the
complications like pulmonary embolism, ARDS, Septic shock. It is important to do a quick
retrospective clinical trials on the COVID-19 patients, who were already on beta-adrenergic
blocker for their previous cardiovascular illness and its effect on mortality. Similarly, it is also
important to do a retrospective study on COVID19 patients, who were treated with beta-
adrenergic agonists in nebulizer solutions and its effect on mortality. Both these proposed
retrospective studies will test the validity of the hypothesis mentioned in this article. If the
retrospective studies result come out as expected, it will help millions of people all over the
world, as beta-adrenergic blockers are well-known drugs, used in the patients for a long time
with good safety profile, it is a low cost, can be used orally and intravenously, easily available
in all parts of the world. It is imperative to do the proposed retrospective and prospective
clinical trial studies as soon as possible, which will clarify the role of beta-adrenergic blockers
and beta-adrenergic agonists in COVID-19 patients in the near future.

Background:

The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 210 000 deaths worldwide. However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features.

Objective:

To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests.

Design:

Prospective cohort study.

Setting:

Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.

Patients:

The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths.

Measurements:

Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated.

Results:
Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (
n
= 10) or outpatient sector (
n
= 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart.

Limitation:

Limited sample size.

Conclusion:

The high incidence of thromboembolic events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.

Since it was first detected in December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread from the central Chinese province of Hubei to almost every country in the world (
1
,
2
). Most persons with COVID-19 have a mild disease course, but about 20% develop a more severe course with a high mortality rate (
3
). As of 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million persons have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 210 000 of them have died (
4
). Why the new coronavirus seems to have a much higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu is not completely understood. Some authors have reported potential risk factors for a more severe disease course, including elevated D-dimer levels, a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and older age (
5
,
6
). Because of the novelty of the pathogen, little is known about the causes of death in affected patients and its specific pathologic features. Despite modern diagnostic tests, autopsy is still of great importance and may be a key to understanding the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of the disease. Ideally, knowledge gained in this way can influence therapeutic strategies and ultimately reduce mortality. To our knowledge, only 3 case reports have been published about COVID-19 patients who have undergone complete autopsy (
7
,
8
). Therefore, in this study we investigated the value of autopsy for determining the cause of death and describe the pathologic characteristics in patients who died of COVID-19.

Methods

Study Design

In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the authorities of the German federal state of Hamburg ordered mandatory autopsies in all patients dying with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The legal basis for this was section 25(
4
) of the German Infection Protection Act. Because of legal regulations, no COVID-19 death was exempted from this order, even if its clinical cause seemed obvious. The case series demonstrated herein consists of 12 consecutive autopsies, starting with the first known SARS-CoV-2-positive death occurring in Hamburg (the second largest city in Germany, with 1.8 million inhabitants). All autopsies were performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians was informed about the study (no. WF-051/20). The study was approved by the local clinical institutional review board and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. In all deceased patients, postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) and a complete autopsy, including histopathologic and virologic evaluation, were performed. Clinical records were checked for preexisting medical conditions and medications, current medical course, and antemortem diagnostic findings.

PMCT, Autopsy, and Histologic Examination

Computed tomographic examination was done at the Department of Legal Medicine with a Philips Brilliance 16-slice multidetector scanner in accordance with an established protocol (
9
). In brief, full-body computed tomography was performed from top to thigh (slice thickness, 1 mm; pitch, 1.5; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAs), complemented by dedicated scans of the thorax with higher resolution (slice thickness, 0.8 mm; pitch, 1.0; 120 kV; 230 to 250 mAS). We performed external examinations and full-body autopsies on all deceased persons with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (PCR confirmed) as soon as possible after taking proper safety precautions (using personal protection equipment with proper donning and doffing), following guidelines from the German Association of Pathologists, which are closely aligned with relevant international guidelines. The recently published recommendations for the performance of autopsies in cases of suspected COVID-19 were taken into account (
10
). The interval from death to postmortem imaging and autopsy (postmortem interval) ranged from 1 to 5 days. During autopsy, tissue samples for histology were taken from the following organs: heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, brain, prostate and testes (in males), ovaries (in females), small bowel, saphenous vein, common carotid artery, pharynx, and muscle.

For virologic testing, we took small samples of heart, lungs, liver, kidney, saphenous vein, and pharynx and sampled the venous blood.

Tissue samples for histopathologic examination were fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde and processed via standard procedure to slides stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For the lung samples, we also used the keratin marker AE1/AE3 (Dako) for immunohistochemistry.

Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA Reverse Transcription PCR From Tissue

Tissue samples were ground by using ceramic beads (Precellys lysing kit) and extracted by using automated nucleic acid extraction (MagNA Pure 96 [Roche]) according to manufacturer recommendations. For virus quantification in tissues, a previously published assay was adopted with modifications (
11
). One-step real-time PCR was run on the LightCycler 480 system (Roche) by using a 1-step RNA control kit (Roche) as master mix. The C
t
(cycle threshold) value for the target SARS-CoV-2 RNA (fluorescein) and whole-process RNA control (Cy5) was determined by using the second derivative maximum method. For quantification, standard in vitro-transcribed RNA of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 was used (
12
). These samples were also analyzed in a study focusing on renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 (Puelles V, et al. Multi-organ and renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2. In preparation).

Statistical Analysis

Data that were normally distributed are presented as means (SDs); data outside the normal distribution are presented as medians (ranges). Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. All data were analyzed with Statistica, version 13 (StatSoft).

Role of the Funding Source

The sponsor was not involved in the design or conduct of the study, nor in the analysis of the data or the decision to submit the manuscript.

Results

Clinical Data

The median age of the 12 patients included in this study was 73 years (interquartile range, 18.5); 25% were women. For all patients, preexisting chronic medical conditions, such as obesity, coronary heart disease, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and neurodegenerative diseases, could be identified (
Table 1
). Two patients died out of the hospital after unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 5 died after treatment in the intensive care unit, and the remaining 5 had an advanced directive for best supportive care and died in the non-intensive care ward. Laboratory results for clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation were not available for the patients who died out of the hospital. In the remaining patients, the most striking features of the initial laboratory test were elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (median, 7.83 ukat/L [range, 2.71 to 11.42 ukat/L]), D-dimer (available for 5 patients; median, 495.24 nmol/L [range, 20.38 to >1904.76 nmol/L]), and C-reactive protein (median, 189 mg/L [range, 18 to 348 mg/L]), as well as mild thrombocytopenia in 4 of 10 patients. A procalcitonin test had been performed in 6 patients, and the results were negative in all but 1 patient with pneumonia (case 10).
Table 2
provides an overview of the initial laboratory results.

Table 1. Patient Characteristics and Autopsy Findings

Table 2. Overview of Laboratory Results Taken at the Time of Hospitalization*

PMCT

In 2 cases (2 and 4), PMCT was not possible for logistic reasons. In the remaining cases, PMCT demonstrated mixed patterns of reticular infiltrations and severe, dense, consolidating infiltrates in both lungs in the absence of known preexisting pathology (such as emphysema or tumor). A juxtaposition of antemortem and postmortem findings is demonstrated in
Figure 1
. A complete summary of PMCT findings is presented in
Table 1
.

Autopsy

In 4 cases (1, 3, 4, and 12), massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death, with the thrombi deriving from the deep veins of the lower extremities. In another 3 cases (5, 8, and 11), fresh deep venous thrombosis was present in the absence of pulmonary embolism. In all cases with deep venous thrombosis, both legs were involved (
Figure 2
). In 6 of the 9 men (two thirds) included in the study, fresh thrombosis was also present in the prostatic venous plexus (
Appendix Figure 1
, available at Annals.org).

In all 12 cases, the cause of death was found within the lungs or the pulmonary vascular system. However, macroscopically differentiating viral pneumonia with subsequent diffuse alveolar damage (a histologic diagnosis) from bacterial pneumonia was not always possible. Typically, the lungs were congested and heavy, with a maximum combined lung weight of 3420 g in case 11. The mean combined lung weight was 1988 g (median, 2088 g). Standard lung weights for men and women are 840 g and 639 g, respectively (
13
,
14
). Only cases 6 and 9 presented with a relatively low lung weight: 550 g and 890 g, respectively (
Appendix Table 1
, available at Annals.org). The lung surface often displayed mild pleurisy and a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish blue hypercapillarized areas. On the cutting surfaces, this pattern was also visible (
Figure 2
). The consistency of the lung tissue was firm yet friable. In 8 cases, all parts of the lungs were affected by these changes. Cases 6, 7, and 9--occurring in the 3 women of the case series--presented with changes compatible with focal purulent bronchopneumonia. Macroscopically, no changes were observed outside the lungs and respiratory tract, except for splenomegaly in 3 cases, which suggested a viral infection.

Appendix Table 1. Weights of Individual Organs, in Grams, for All Cases*

During autopsy, all cases except for case 6 presented with preexisting heart disease, including high-grade coronary artery sclerosis (7 of 12); myocardial scarring, indicating ischemic heart disease (6 of 12); and congestive cardiomyopathy. Mean heart weight was 503 g (median, 513 g). In addition to this finding, the most common accompanying diseases were pulmonary emphysema (6 of 12) and ischemic enteritis (3 of 12). Often these conditions were known to the treating physician before death (compare columns 4 and 10 of
Table 1
). The macroscopic autopsy findings are presented organ by organ in
Appendix Table 2
(available at Annals.org) and the lung findings in
Table 1
.

Histology

Histopathology of the lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with early acute respiratory distress syndrome in 8 cases. Predominant findings were hyaline membranes (
Figure 3
,
A and B
), activated pneumocytes, microvascular thromboemboli, capillary congestion, and protein-enriched interstitial edema. As described by Wang and colleagues (
15
), a moderate degree of inflammatory infiltrates concurred with clinically described leukopenia in patients with COVID-19 and predominant infiltration of lymphocytes fit the picture of a viral pathogenesis. In later stages, squamous metaplasia was present (
Figure 3
,
C
). Long-term changes, such as destruction of alveolar septae and lymphocytic infiltration of the bronchi, were often visible as preexisting conditions. Four cases (6, 8, 9, and 10) showed no diffuse alveolar damage but extensive granulocytic infiltration of the alveoli and bronchi, resembling bacterial focal bronchopneumonia. Histologically, thromboemboli were detectable in cases 1, 3, 4, and 5 (
Figure 3
,
D
). Microthrombi were regularly found within small lung arteries, occasionally within the prostate, but not in other organs.

In addition to the lung changes described in
Table 1
, there were isolated histologic findings that might indicate a viral infection. The pharyngeal mucosa was examined in 7 cases. In 6 of them, hyperemia and alternating dense, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates were found as signs of chronic pharyngitis. In 1 case (case 3), lymphocytic myocarditis was seen in the right ventricle (
Appendix Figure 2
, available at Annals.org). The remaining histologic changes were compatible with shock changes in part of the deceased patient (liver, kidneys, intestine) or corresponded to the macroscopically determined virus-independent preexisting pathology (such as ischemic cardiomyopathy).

Apart from findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients showed other histopathologic findings related to their chronic preexisting conditions, including hypertrophy of myocardial fibers or scarring of the myocardium. The peripheral veins, including those occluded by thrombi, showed no abnormalities on hematoxylin-eosin staining.

PCR Results

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs of all 12 patients (range, 1.2x10
4
to 9x10
9
copies/mL) and in the pharynx of 9 patients. Six patients showed moderate viremia (<4x10
4
copies/mL). In 5 of these patients, viral RNA was also detected in other tissues (heart, liver, or kidney) in concentrations exceeding viremia. Patients without viremia showed no or a low virus load in the other tissues. Only 4 patients had detectable viral RNA in the brain and saphenous vein.

Discussion

In this autopsy study of 12 consecutive patients who died of COVID-19, we found a high incidence of deep venous thrombosis (58%). One third of the patients had a pulmonary embolism as the direct cause of death. Furthermore, diffuse alveolar damage was demonstrated by histology in 8 patients (67%).

To our knowledge, this is the first case series summarizing and comparing clinical data of consecutive COVID-19 cases with findings obtained by a full autopsy, supplemented by PMCT, histology, and virology.

The high rate of death-causing pulmonary embolism at autopsy correlates well with the unsuccessful resuscitation of 3 of 4 patients, 2 of whom died out of the hospital. Apart from that, no preclinical evidence had been reported of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis.

In studies that examined deceased patients with COVID-19 without relying on autopsy, no increased rates of pulmonary embolism were observed clinically. However, it is known that many cases of pulmonary embolism remain clinically overlooked and are often associated with sudden, unexpected death. This may have been aggravated by the method for diagnosing COVID-19 in Germany, which is based on PCR tests rather than computed tomographic imaging because of concerns about infection of medical staff and other patients. A recent report described clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 from Wuhan (
16
). Besides respiratory failure, the cause of death was multiorgan failure in 16% and cardiac arrest in 9%. No autopsies were performed. The gold standard for identifying cause of death is still the autopsy (
17
). However, in-hospital autopsy rates have declined worldwide over the past decades. Also, because of pathologists' potential risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, very few autopsies have been performed worldwide (
18
). To our knowledge, only 3 case reports have been published on patients with COVID-19 who have undergone complete autopsy and a few more in which only lung tissue was examined (
7
,
8
).

Other researchers have described coagulopathy as a common complication in patients with severe COVID-19 (
5
,
6
,
19
). In a recent study of 191 patients with COVID-19, 50% of those who died had coagulopathy, compared with 7% of survivors. D-dimer levels greater than 1000 ug/L were associated with a fatal outcome (
6
).

COVID-19 may predispose to venous thromboembolism in several ways. The coagulation system may be activated by many different viruses, including HIV, dengue virus, and Ebola virus (
20
,
21
). In particular, coronavirus infections may be a trigger for venous thromboembolism, and several pathogenetic mechanisms are involved, including endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased levels of von Willebrand factor; systemic inflammation, by Toll-like receptor activation; and a procoagulatory state, by tissue factor pathway activation (
22
). In a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19, high plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed (
23
). The direct activation of the coagulation cascade by a cytokine storm is conceivable. With COVID-19, severe hypoxemia develops in some patients (
24
). Thrombus formation under hypoxic conditions is facilitated both in animal models of thrombosis and in humans. The vascular response to hypoxia is controlled primarily by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, whose target genes include several factors that regulate thrombus formation (
25
). Lastly, indirect causes, such as immune-mediated damage by antiphospholipid antibodies, may partially contribute, as speculated by Zhang and colleagues (
26
).

The macroscopic findings in our autopsy series--with rather heavy, consolidated, friable, basically air-free lungs in most of the cases--were impressive and explain the difficulties in sufficiently ventilating some of these patients. The histopathologic changes in most of our cases with diffuse alveolar damage as the main finding resemble those described by Xu and colleagues (
7
) and Barton and colleagues (
8
), who reported single cases; Zhang and colleagues (
26
), who reported on lung biopsy in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 positivity; and Tian and colleagues (
27
), who described macroscopic and histologic pulmonary findings in 2 patients with lung cancer who received positive results on SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, the full-blown picture of diffuse alveolar damage seems to be more prevalent in younger patients with fewer preexisting diseases and longer survival, whereas older patients with more comorbid conditions tend to die in the early stages of the disease.

In line with clinical, macroscopic, and histopathologic findings, PCR detected the highest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lung and pharyngeal tissue. Of interest, in most patients with disease, high titers of RNA were also detected in postmortem samples. The clinical relevance of this is not yet clear. Clearance of viral RNA from blood 7 days after transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with substantial clinical improvement, but studies have not shown a correlation between viremia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 (
28
,
29
). As in patients with SARS-CoV-1, in whom viral replication could be detected in other organs, including the liver, kidney, spleen, and cerebrum (
30
), we detected viral RNA at high titers in other organs (liver, kidney, and heart) in 5 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may spread via the bloodstream and infect other organs. To prove this, replication intermediates must be detected.

The current study had some limitations: First, the sample size was small, possibly leading to overestimation of the rate of pulmonary embolism. However, both the clinical and postmortem observations agree well with the current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 pathology. This includes the sex and age distribution as well as the preexisting conditions among the patients, but also the histologic findings. Second, although viral titers in swabs (pharynx) taken longitudinally up to 7 days after death remained similar, we lack data on how postmortem processes affect viral titers and dynamics in different tissues and body fluids. Moreover, the quantitative PCR assay used cannot discriminate between genomic and subgenomic RNA. As stated earlier, to prove viral replication, detection of replication intermediates or antigenomic RNA would be necessary.

In conclusion, we found a high incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19. When hemodynamic deterioration occurs in a patient with COVID-19, pulmonary embolism should always be suspected. That patients with COVID-19 who have increased D-dimer levels, a sign of coagulopathy, may benefit from anticoagulant treatment seems plausible (
31
). As demonstrated in our cohort, this might be important for hospitalized patients and outpatients. In this context, some professional societies have already made recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for patients with COVID-19 (
32
). Robust evidence, however, remains scant, and further prospective studies are urgently needed to confirm and validate these results.

We were not aware about the restrictions to use of percentages and would like to apologize for its excessive use. Also we do not understand how this lessens the impact of our manuscript we must state that we did not intended to disguise any results. Due to the small base number of cases presented in our manuscript we assumed that the academic readership would be easily able to transfer percentages into real numbers.

Reply to D'Amico et al.

In their comment Prof. D'Amico and colleagues raise an interesting point: the aspect of multi-organ involvement in SRAS-CoV-2-infections. In fact focusing on pulmonary pathology alone may not show the whole picture of COVID.(1) With the fast growing knowledge about pathology and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 the scientific community may learn interesting things in the near future.

Better avoid percentages when reporting about 12 autopsies

Wichmann and colleagues give a very informative and thought provoking account of these 12 autopsies. However I must point out their very liberal use of percentages (13 times in the whole manuscript), I am afraid, unfortunately lessens the impact of what they aim to convey.

Pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection: the forgotten colon

Dear Editors,

We read with great interest the article by Wichmann and colleagues recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine (1). Autopsies were performed on 12 patients who died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to further investigate the pathogenesis of this disease. They first confirmed the risks of deep venous thrombosis and ischemic heart disease in individuals infected with COVID-19. Unexpectedly, they also found ischemic enteritis (3/12, 25%) on small bowel biopsies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the lungs of all patients, while in 5 cases viral RNA was found in kidneys, heart, or liver. A growing body of evidence indicates that the colon may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is noteworthy that two central proteins involved in the pathogenesis of the new coronavirus infection, serine protease TMPRSS2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, are highly expressed within the colonic mucosa (2). The former regulates spike protein cleavage allowing its activation, while the latter mediates virus entry into the host cell. Interestingly, the virus has been detected in the feces of positive subjects and gastrointestinal symptoms, among which diarrhea, are experienced in about 10% of patients (3). SARS-CoV-2 has been also identified in endoscopic rectal biopsies of two patients with severe forms of COVID-19, and higher levels of fecal calprotectin, which is known to reflect intestinal inflammation, have been found in patients with diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea (4,5).

Unfortunately, no colonic biopsies were performed by Wichmann et al. (1). COVID-19 mainly affects the tracheobronchial tree and lung parenchyma, and respiratory symptoms are the most frequently encountered. It is the reason why most articles about COVID-19 focused on the respiratory tract at the beginning of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 is now recognized as a systemic disease and gastrointestinal symptoms should not be underestimated. Greater attention should be paid to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the colon. Studies reporting colonic histology of COVID-19 patients are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease, to define whether ischemic and thromboembolic events may occur in the colon, and to explain why patients with gut involvement may have a more severe disease course.

Reply to Epelbaum

In his comment Dr. Epelbaum raises concerns that focusing on venous thromboembolism (VTE) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 is misguiding the attention of colleagues to an epiphenomenon. We strongly disagree with him about this issue especially because in our opinion the references he gives, do not backup his statements. Regarding the statement that VTE prophylaxis ""remains a global deficiency..."" the reference cited a study of Kroger et al. (1) . The main topic of this study was to investigate if patients presenting with VTE/PE in Germany had a risk factor which could have been identified previously. The majority of patients had no medical condition and no identifiable risk factor. Consequently, the algorithm decided against a prophylaxis. Which hardly can be extrapolated to COVID-19 patients. The statement that PE is a common (but rarely fatal) finding in CT of critically ill patients is correct (2) and most likely due to improved CT performance in recent years. Contrasting to this, one third of our patients had a fatal PE. Furthermore Dr. Epelbaum states that we corroborate the consensus statement of Bikdeli et al. to demand general anticoagulation treatment for COVID-19 patients (3). This is not correct, we stress the need for further studies on this subject. The consensus statement focuses in large parts on the effects of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies on anticoagulation strategies for cardio-vascular interventions. A small paragraph cited by Dr. Epelbaum deals with empiric anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients: ""The majority of panel members consider prophylactic anticoagulation, although a minority consider intermediate-dose or therapeutic dose to be reasonable."". The paper was written before our and other studies have been published (4). Because the panel decision was based mainly on a single retrospective study from China in which only laboratory abnormalities have been presented and no autopsies have been conducted (5), our study and the one of Baldi et al. add substantial value to the claim of the consensus statement that for anticoagulation treatment the ""optimal dosing in patients with severe COVID-19 remains unknown and warrants further prospective investigation.""

Venous Thomboembolism in Fatal COVID-19

TO THE EDITOR:
The autopsy series from Germany reported by Wichmann et al (1) was a welcome addition to the growing literature on the postmortem lung histology of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease, though unfortunately the finding of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in terminal cases does little to illuminate the process in its earlier stages. Worrisome, however, was the authors' emphasis on the ""venous thromboembolism"" aspect of their findings, which appears in the title and dominates the concluding paragraph. If assimilated without context by the clinical community, this extract from the study's results could further fuel the pervasive but unsubstantiated belief that COVID-19 is a uniquely hypercoagulable state.

Case 1 in the study is a patient who sustained an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was found to have PE as the likely cause. This is unsurprising, since well before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, PE has been recognized as the most common non-cardioaortic etiology of unsuccessfully resuscitated community arrests (2). The other three PE cases in the series were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU); all were obese and mechanically ventilated. We are not informed whether these patients received appropriate venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, which remains a global deficiency from which Germany is not exempt (3). The antemortem detection rate of incidental PE in general ICU populations receiving mechanical ventilation can approach 20% (with obesity being a risk factor) and exceed that figure in autopsy studies, but this finding has not been linked to inferior outcomes clinically and has rarely been deemed a precipitant of death pathologically (4,5). Turning to specifics pertinent to the patients in the Wichmann series, death with DAD is nearly universally accompanied by pulmonary vascular thrombosis, including macrovascular, so thrombi should not be construed as a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease when DAD is present (6). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 hardly stands out next to other viruses in regard to postmortem VTE; a study of eight autopsies performed on fatal H1N1 influenza cases revealed a higher percentage of PE than did the Wichmann series: 5/8 (63%) versus 4/12 (33%) (7).

Although severe COVID-19 promotes hemostatic dysregulation, it is not alone among critical illnesses, and the findings of the Wichmann series do not advance the theory that critically ill COVID-19 patients are unusually predisposed to VTE and therefore merit an unprecedented approach. The authors, however, allude to the opposite. They invoke an international guidance document as corroboration (8). Majority of its expert author panel, however, voted against routine empirical anticoagulation.

Reply to Srivastava and Thachil

We appreciate the comments of Srivastava and Thachil in which they give an explanation for the origin of micro vascular thrombemboli (MVT) and discuss if the pulmonary embolisms (PE) observed in 4 of our 12 patients were most likely explained by the severe illness of the patients and the prolonged cause of the disease.We would like to state that to the best of our judgement MVT and PE result from different pathological mechanisms. We observed MVT ubiquitously in all parts of the lung, but in contrast to Srivastava and Thachil we do not consider this as a specific feature of SARC-CoV-2-pneumonia.

We think it is rather a long known finding in viral pneumonias, resulting from the interaction of the innate immunity and a viral pathogen. Identical findings have been first describer in patient during the 1918 Influenza pandemic and for many other viral pathogens later (1).With respect to the comment on the origin of PE in our patients we admit that many of them were severely ill and were at high risk for PE. But half of the patients who died from PE were only mildly ill and had a cardiac arrest as outpatients. Which emphasizes the need for urgent research in this area.

Reply to Mirijello et al.

We appreciate the thoughtful comments of Antonio Mirijello and colleagues. Indeed, the underlying conditions leading to thromboembolisms in COVID-19 patients are not completely understood. As demonstrated in our manuscript the potential benefit of D-dimer testing was also not clear to us. As a result of this study we have implemented the test into our regular routine for COVID-19-patients.We also value the comment on the uncertainty regarding the clinical implications of our findings. Which patient groups might benefit from an intensified prophylaxis with LMWH or if there are certain ""high-risk"" groups which might even benefit from a prolonged treatment with oral anticoagulants (DOAC or VKA) remains subject to ongoing studies.

Autopsy findings in COVID-19 - Is it thrombosis or embolism?

Sir, We read with interest the excellent detailed report on autopsy findings in patients with COVID-19 infection.(1) The authors' description of the gross and histopathology of changes in the lung emphasizing the thrombosis in microvasculature and haemorrhage in the alveoli is very significant. It would have been useful to include more details about the microthrombi in the arteries particularly whether it was found in all decedents. The presence of extensive microvascular thrombi is highly suggestive of a local thrombotic process.(2)

Even though 7 out of the 12 patients evaluated in this series had evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), in all probability, this was a late effect in patients who were seriously ill for several days in the hospital. The primary event is very likely to have been pulmonary thrombosis as evidenced by extensive microthrombi in small pulmonary arteries of these decedents. The autopsy features described in this report support the hypothesis that the predominant pathology in these patients with COVID-19 associated hemostasis abnormality (CAHA) is microvascular thrombosis. Even at its early stage in ambulant patients, the breakdown of these micro-clots tend to cause raised d-dimer levels.(3) With disease progression, the marked coagulation activation and extensive microthrombi lead to extremely high d-dimer levels which have been shown to correlate with worse clinical outcomes.(4) It is important to recognize this spectrum of early to late CAHA to plan timely interventions. In this report, d-dimer levels were highly elevated (20-2000 fold) in all five patients for whom this data was available. Therefore it was extensive thrombosis rather than 'pneumonia' which was the cause of respiratory failure.

We would like to emphasize that pulmonary vascular changes in CAHA is distinct from classical 'thromboembolism'. In COVID-19, the cause of thrombi in pulmonary vasculature is not distal thrombosis embolizing to the lung but rather de novo thrombosis in the microvasculature. The fact that alveolar type 2 cells and the endothelium in the lung share receptors which mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection further supports this hypothesis. Recognizing this difference between early, localized, organ-specific pulmonary thrombosis leading to respiratory failure and systemic thromboembolism in the late stages is critical to planning suitable investigations and management strategies. Needless to say, early use of anticoagulants in patients with high or rising d-dimer levels is paramount and have already been shown to improve survival. (5)

Comment on Wichmann D et al.: Thrombotic complications of COVID-19

TO THE EDITOR:

We read with great interest the article by Wichmann and colleagues [1] examining twelve consecutive
patients deceased because of Sars-Cov-2 infection. Autoptic studies are pivotal in understanding
mechanisms of new and unknown diseases, particularly for COVID-19.

The main finding was the high prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in seven patients (58%), being
pulmonary embolism (PE) the direct cause of death in four patients (33%) [1].

In line with literature reports [2], all the evaluated patients were affected by chronic comorbidities (e.g.
cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, neurological, oncological).

Among the seven patients with DVT [1], four underwent mechanical ventilation: all developed venous
thromboembolism (VTE) and three died of PE. Only two out of seven DVT patients had received prophylaxis
for VTE with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). However, this treatment was not effective in
preventing VTE, as both died because of PE. D-dimer for both were not available. Indeed, D-dimer levels
had been assessed in only five out of twelve patients; excluding two out of hospital deaths, only five out of
ten patients (50%) had a D-dimer assay in their clinical records. No autoptic signs of VTE were found in
those two patients on treatment with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

These are our considerations: COVID-19 patients are heterogeneous in terms of characteristics and clinical
management (ICU vs general wards). As underlined [1], COVID-19 is associated with thrombotic
manifestations and coagulopathy, negatively influencing the disease course [3]. Besides VTE, the
mechanism of pulmonary vascular thrombosis has been hypothesized as a consequence of interstitial
pneumonia causing a severe acute inflammation and prothrombotic complement/cytokines-mediated
endothelial dysfunction [4]. In this context, anticoagulant treatment seems to reduce mortality in severe
patients with coagulopathy (e.g. high D-dimer) [5].

Thrombotic risk of acute medical patients is often underestimated given the lack of clinical signs of
thrombosis (e.g. swollen leg, Homan's sign). However, acute conditions (i.e. respiratory failure) together
with comorbidities significantly raise this risk. In the setting of COVID-19, validated prediction scores and D-
dimer testing are useful to assess thrombotic risk and for risk stratification.

Whether all COVID-19 patients should receive standard or intermediate-doses LMWH prophylaxis for the
prevention of thrombotic complications remains an open question. Similarly, the utility of lower limbs
compression ultrasonography or pulmonary CT angiography to high-risk patients as well as the role of
DOACs need further evaluation."

Abstract:
Understanding the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 patient phenotypes is
necessary to derive fine-grained resolution of pathophysiology. Here we use
state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine
intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical notes
from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By
contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of
COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg,
n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we
identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea
(2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and
cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients.
The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in
COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with
anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19
(4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an
Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional
knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling
up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural
networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of

J Thromb Haemost 2020 …","Objectives: To review current available data on the association between D-Dimer levels and mortality in patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of published studies using MEDLINE and EMBASE through 13 April 2020. Two authors independently screened all records and extracted the outcomes. A random effects model was used to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results: Six original studies enrolling 1355 hospitalized patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 (391 in the non-survivor group and 964 in the survivor group) were considered for the final pooled analysis. When pooling together the results of these studies, D-Dimer levels were found to be higher in non-survivors than in-survivors. The SMD in D-Dimer levels between non-survivors and survivors was 3.59 ug/L (95% CI 2.79-4.40 ug/L), and the Z-score for overall effect was 8.74 (p < 0.00001), with a high heterogeneity across studies (I2=95%).

Conclusions: Despite high heterogeneity across included studies, the present pooled analysis indicates that D-Dimer levels are significantly associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Early integration of D-Dimer testing, which is a rapid, inexpensive, and easily accessible biological test, can be useful to better risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients."

Patient 1
is a 50-year-old male with past medical history (PMH) of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The patient presented with dyspnoea on day 14 of symptoms. His deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was increased to enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously twice a day. On day 23 of symptoms, the patient was noted to have left upper extremity weakness, code 'stroke' was called. Serial computed tomography (CT) showed a non-haemorrhagic right parietal infarct and the patient was given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The patient's neurological deficits resolved after tPA, but then he had an acute mental status change and was intubated to protect his airway. The patient was started on a full dose of enoxaparin for new onset rapid atrial fibrillation. On day 25 of symptoms, the patient developed a cool left lower extremity. Arterial Doppler showed no flow distal to the popliteal artery while on enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice a day. He was transferred for surgical intervention, but did not undergo any surgical intervention and ultimately died.

Patient 2
is a 65-year-old male with PMH of dilated aortic root. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with progressively worsening dyspnoea on day 8 of symptoms. On symptom day 17, the patient had an acute increase in D-dimer to 12 597, was started on argatroban drip, transferred to the ICU and started on Hi-flow nasal cannula. On symptom day 19, right arterial Doppler showed no significant flow in the right popliteal artery, posterior tibial, anterior tibial, peroneal or dorsalis pedis arteries. Vascular surgery performed fasciotomy with thromboembolectomy of the right lower extremity. On symptom day 20, the patient was started on a heparin drip after failing argatroban drip post-thromboembolectomy. On symptom day 21, the patient went for a second emergent thromboembolectomy, went into ventricular tachycardic arrest intraoperatively, but achieved return of spontaneous circulation, and was found to have a massive pulmonary embolism with right ventricular strain by transthoracic echocardiogram and was treated with tPA.

Patient 3
is a 69-year-old male with PMH of coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease Stage III. The patient presented with dyspnoea, non-productive cough, fatigue, chills, headache, profuse watery diarrhoea and intermittent fevers on day 10 of symptoms. On day 11 of symptoms, the patient was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient remained intubated for 7 days. On day 23 of symptoms, the patient had a syncopal event for which a CT head showed an ill-defined low-density focus within the left thalamus, suspicious for acute infarct. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hyper-intense signal within the left thalamus, with a small amount of associated enhancement, interpreted as likely a subacute infarct. The patient was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel and statin therapy. The patient initially did well, but 1 day after finishing a taper of steroids he was readmitted with laryngeal oedema. He did well after additional steroids were given.

Discussion

The mechanism for coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 is currently unknown.
7
The thromboembolic events described in these cases occurred after the cytokine storm and during the third week of the disease, despite having no risk factors for thromboembolism and being on intermediate prophylaxis dose. The arterial clots removed at surgery in the patient described in case two were white and consistent with being platelet-rich.
8
It is unclear and perhaps unlikely that the same mechanisms are involved in venous as in arterial clots, but this gross appearance suggested an important role of platelets and the possibility that anti-platelet agents, such as aspirin, may play a role in preventing arterial thromboembolic complications.
9
In terms of preventing and treating venous thromboembolic disease there remains limited evidence or guidance from well-controlled trials on whether low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, direct thrombin inhibition or other approaches are optimal.

While both articles are interesting and further generate hypotheses about the causal role of pulmonary embolism (PE) in clinical worsening of patients with COVID-19, we would like to take a moment to reflect on their papers, with an intriguing case presentation that highlights and further substantiates several key points.

We describe a patient with COVID-19 who consecutively developed an arterial (ischemic stroke) and venous thromboembolic event (PE) despite thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), following treatment for ischemic stroke with intravenous rt-PA (alteplase) and clopidogrel. On top of that PE was diagnosed after two previously performed CTPA imaging studies were negative.

(A)
High resolution chest CT scan performed at admission, showing ground-glass abnormalities with and without reticulation (""crazy paving"") with a predominantly peripheral distribution, consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia.

(B)
CTPA performed at admission that did not reveal signs of pulmonary emboli.

(C)
High resolution chest CT scan performed on day 2, showing a marked increase in COVID-19-related pulmonary involvement and new areas of consolidation.

(D)
CTPA performed on day 2, again showing no signs of pulmonary embolism.

(E)
High resolution chest CT scan performed on day 7, showing improvement of COVID-19-related pulmonary changes with less extensive abnormalities and signs compatible with organising pneumonia.

On day 2, COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of SARS-CoV2-mRNA with a Ct value of 23. The patient deteriorated rapidly and was transferred to the medium care unit (MCU) for intensified oxygen therapy via a non-rebreathing mask (15 L, FiO2 80%). A new CTPA was performed, showing severe progression of ground glass opacities and crazy paving patterns (
Fig. 1
c) and PE was again ruled out (
Fig. 1
d).

On day 5, the patient developed dysarthria, left-sided weakness and neglect. CT-imaging of the brain (including CT-angiography and CT-perfusion) showed no brain haemorrhage (
Fig. 2
a ) or arterial occlusion, yet a defect right frontal with large mismatch between perfusion and vascular volume recordings, indicative of right frontal lobe infarction, was seen (
Fig. 2
b). No atrial fibrillation (AF) was observed in the MCU. He received intravenous rt-PA and after 24 h clopidogrel was initiated for secondary stroke prevention. Pragmatically, thromboprophylaxis was also increased to intermediate dose (nadroparin 5700 IU sc daily).

On day 7, further respiratory deterioration occurred. PE was deemed unlikely because of the recently administered rt-PA, intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis, clopidogrel and two recent negative CTPAs. Nevertheless, a third CTPA was performed after a chest x-ray had excluded pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and repeated d-dimers were >10,000 mg/L. Remarkably, the COVID19-associated lung damage seemed to be improving (
Fig. 1
e), but multiple PE in the right pulmonary artery (
Fig. 1
f) and bilateral (sub)segmental PE were found. Therapeutic LMWH (tinzaparin 18,000 IU sc daily) was initiated. The patient is still recovering in the MCU, but is soon to be discharged to a regular nursing ward. Of note, family history for (VTE) and antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, IgG and IgM for anticardiolipin and IgG for anti-b2-glycoprotein I) were negative.

Discussion

COVID-19 appears to be associated with a strong thrombotic tendency, due to thrombo-inflammation, probably driven by distinct mechanisms that still require exploration [

First, it reveals an unusually high burden of consecutive thromboembolic events in both the arterial and venous vascular beds, despite thromboprophylaxis and several other anticoagulant treatments, and in the absence of additional risk factors including atrial fibrillation, family history for VTE, or antiphospolipid antibodies. An additional risk factor for stroke that was not excluded was patent foramen ovale. Although, transthoracic echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart, no 'bubble-contrast' study was performed. However, according to young stroke guidelines [

] combined with patient's age, calcifications at the level of the carotid bifurcation, and history of PAD, there was no strict indication to perform such a contrast study.

Second, it also shows the diagnostic challenges in patients with COVID-19, and in particular those who deteriorate rapidly. The impossibility to differentiate between respiratory failure due to progression of lung-tissue related abnormalities such as ground glass opacities or ARDS on the one hand and PE on the other hand is unprecedented. Where normally an alternative diagnosis is rather reassuring and actually reduces the risk of concurrent PE, in patients with COVID-19 this is at least questionable. In fact, our case shows that both, progression of COVID-related abnormalities and PE, can occur simultaneously or in a very short time frame. Eventually, repeated d-dimer (>10.000 mg/L) was decisive to perform CTPA a third time. A report of the National Institute of Public Health for the Netherlands (RIVM) suggests that the combination of d-dimer levels increasing progressively and clinical worsening is suggestive for PE [

]. Therefore, we believe that CTPA should be considered at a low threshold in patients with unexplained respiratory deterioration, certainly when d-dimer levels have increased progressively. In retrospect, we could have performed compression ultrasonography of the legs (CUS) before proceeding to the second or third CTPA [

]. If CUS would have been positive, an indication for anticoagulant therapy would be present already and another CTPA could have been avoided. It also would have helped in fully understanding the course of events, although deep vein thrombosis is lacking in the majority of patients [

In summary, this case highlights hypercoagulability as a major contributor to COVID-19 related complications and suggests that commonly used diagnostic and therapeutic approaches may be insufficient to ameliorate the risk of thromboembolic events, underscoring the need to remain vigilant for the occurrence of these events in patients with COVID-19.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the healthcare system of the world has been overwhelmed by this pandemic. The most recent statistic showed that there are now over 3 million people infected and over 259 000 deaths in 210 countries.

This pandemic has presented a major challenge to the care of patients with other medical conditions such as stroke, which affects 1 in 4 people over the age of 25 in their lifetime and kills about 5.5 million each year.
2 3
There have been reports showing that stroke centres and hospitals are seeing a significant drop in stroke admissions since the pandemic.

Realising this challenge and urgency, the Chinese Stroke Association convened a group of international stroke leaders and discussed the challenges facing stroke care worldwide and recommendations of stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic is at different stages in different countries. While China is slowly opening up its cities after the lockdown, some countries may be at the plateau stage and others have not reached the peak yet. COVID-19 is unlikely to be a short-term pandemic. Both Korea and China have seen pockets of resurgence of cases. There is concern that a second wave of the pandemic may come in the fall of 2020.

COVID-19 will thus likely change our way of delivering stroke care for years to come. The world should be proactive in how to meet the challenges. The stroke care model may need to adapt, however, so that the ...

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the main manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causes for VTE are multifactorial and are not readily apparent in many cases. Hypercoagulable states (including antiphospholipid syndrome), are considered risk factors for the development of VTE [

]. A Chinese center reported a case series of three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid antibodies represented by anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-b2-glycoprotein I (ab2GPI). No lupus anticoagulant was detected in any of these patients [

]. A French group published a brief letter studying 56 patients of which 25 patients (45%) were positive for lupus anticoagulant (LAC), while aCL or ab2GPI were detected in only 5 out of 50 tested patients (10%, 3 associated to LAC) using IgG and IgM detection. However, the investigators did not report thrombotic complications in these patients [

]. These findings could suggest a role of antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of thrombosis (either arterial or venous) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and confirmed VTE.

2.
Material and method

This was a prospective observational study performed at a third-level hospital in Madrid. From March 26 to April 15, 2020, all consecutive patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine ward with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and diagnosed with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by objective tests (compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT; helical computed tomography [CT] scan for suspected PE) were screened for antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients were included in the study if they were older than 18 years. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined by positive PCR in nasopharyngeal swab or by the presence of radiological and analytical findings highly suggestive of the disease. Patients were excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome or previous assessment of antiphospholipid antibodies.

Patients included in the study were tested for antiphospholipid antibodies: anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-b2-glycoprotein I (ab2GPI). Antibodies were detected by indirect solid phase ELISA (ORG 515, Orgentec(r)) for anticardiolipin antibodies (normal range was: IgM aCL 0-7 U/mL, IgG aCL 0-10 U/mL) and by indirect solid phase ELISA (ORG 521, Orgentec(r)) for ab2GPI antibodies (normal range was: IgM ab2GPI 0-8 U/mL, IgG ab2GPI 0-8 U/mL). Lupus anticoagulant was not assessed since testing is not recommended in acutely ill patients and under anticoagulant therapy. Oral informed consent was obtained in all patients prior to their participation in the study. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. The authors received no specific funding for this work. Local protocol for thromboprophylaxis consisted in enoxaparin 40 mg per day or bemiparin 3500 UI per day.

Results

The study comprised 24 patients. During the study period, there were 785 patients admitted to Internal Medicine ward with diagnosis of COVID-19; thus, incidence of VTE in these population was 3.0% (95% IC 1.8-4.3%). Of these, 367 were discharged at the time of analysis; the incidence of VTE in these population was 6.5% (95% IC 4.2-9.6%). All but five patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis prior to VTE diagnosis. Mean age of the sample was 64.3 (SD 14.4) and 58.3% were male. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the sample at the diagnosis of VTE are summarized in
Table 1
. None of them had known thrombophilia, recent long travel or pregnancy. Six patients (25%) were diagnosed with VTE on admission. For the rest of patients, median days from admission to VTE diagnosis were 14 (IQR 9.5-18). Eleven (45.8%) patients presented PE alone, nine (37.5%) patients presented DVT alone and four (16.6%) patients presented PE and DVT. Among patients with PE (
n
= 15), 6 (40%) patients had intermediate-high risk PE and 9 (60%) patients had low risk PE, respectively. Location of the thrombosis is included in
Table 1
. No episodes of arterial thrombosis were observed. Two patients (8.3%) were weakly positive for anticardiolipin IgM (19.3 U/mL and 15.8 U/mL, respectively [normal range: 0-7 U/mL]) and anti-b2-glycoprotein I IgM (14.1 U/mL and 16.2 U/mL, respectively [normal range: 0-8 U/mL]). Anticardiolipin IgG and anti-b2-glycoprotein I IgG were negative in all patients.

]. However, scarce data has been published about the incidence of VTE in these patients. A multicenter study of 184 patients with severe COVID-19 reported a VTE cumulative incidence of 27% (95% CI 17-37%) despite adequate thromboprophylaxis [

]. These results suggested that VTE could remain underdiagnosed in patients with severe COVID-19.

The sample of our study consisted in 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and venous thromboembolism. Among them, 72.2% had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 66.6% had >4 points according SOFA, denoting the markedly high severity of the sample. However, at the time of the study period no patient had died and 62.5% had been discharged. Despite the severity of the clinical presentation, thrombocytopenia was not frequent. On the other hand, markedly high D-dimer levels were found in the majority of the sample. The two previously mentioned publications [

] had suggested a role of antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and thrombotic complications. The first article was a case series of 3 patients from a Chinese center. In this publication, titration of antibodies was not reported and 2/3 patients had a high cardiovascular risk and previous history of thrombosis [

]. The second article was a brief letter studying 56 patients from two French centers. Among them, aCL or ab2GPI were detected in only 5 out of 50 tested patients (10%, 3 of them associated to lupus anticoagulant) using IgG and IgM detection. Again, the investigators did not report the titres of the antibodies and their sample did not comprise patients with thrombotic events [

]. Antiphospholipid antibodies abnormally target phospholipid proteins, and the presence of these antibodies is central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, these antibodies can also arise transiently in patients with critical illness and various infections [

]. Our study only found 2 (8.3%) patients with anticardiolipin IgM and anti-b2-glycoprotein I IgM weakly positive, suggesting that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is not frequent among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who suffer venous thromboembolism.

This study has several limitations: First, the study was limited to acutely ill patients in non-ICU setting and may not be representative of the whole COVID-19 population. Second, it did not include a serologic confirmation 3 months after the first positive measurement of antiphospholipid antibodies. Third, the restricted sample size could have limited the clinical significance of our findings. Fourth, the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in non-VTE patients is unknown.

In conclusion, the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies among COVID-19 patients with VTE in our cohort was low, suggesting that antiphospholipid antibodies might not be involved in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia."

EJRC - COVID-19: associated thrombosis risk

Anti-coagulation in COVID-19 patients: More questions than answers?

Coagulation dysfunction constitutes a part of the sepsis pathophysiology. (1) Targeting such dysfunction had been previously investigated with the aim to improve sepsis outcome (e.g. Activated Protein C). (2) Critically-ill patients are also at increased risk of thrombo-embolism due to other reasons (e.g. Immobility, dehydration, intravascular catheters, etc).

Recently, there have been increased concerns about hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients; and D-Dimer became a part of the laboratory work-up in many centres.

Klok et al
conducted an observational study of 184 COVID-19 ICU patients in three Dutch hospitals to investigate the incidence of thrombotic complications. (3) Patients were generally overweight (Mean 87 Kg) and 2.7% had active cancer. They were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation (9.2% on therapeutic anticoagulation and 38% had a coagulation abnormality). The median follow-up was 7 days (IQR: 1-13 days).

31 patients developed thromboembolism (25 CTPA confirmed PE, 1 DVT, 2 catheter related thrombus and 3 ischemic stroke). No myocardial infarction nor systemic arterial embolism were observed. The cumulative incidence (number of events adjusted for the at-risk period for each patient) was high at 31%. Diagnostic tests were undertaken based on clinical suspicion, and as such the authors hypothesised that the true incidence may be even higher.

The cumulative incidence graph shows that the thrombotic complications reach a plateau at day-10 after ICU admission. Age and coagulopathy (spontaneously prolonged PT > 3 sec and aPTT > 5 sec) were risk factors as per regression analysis.

The study represents an important step and can impact the management. This is not the first work highlighting hypercoagulability in COVID-19.
Zhang et al
also documented three cases with thrombosis and positive antiphospholipid antibodies. (4) However, the work done by
Klok et al
did not explore the underlying mechanism. The complexity of the coagulation system means different drugs can target different molecules or pathways. The radiologically evident thrombosis can also be the tip of an iceberg, which includes microcirculatory thrombosis (e.g. Pulmonary microthrombi).

An understanding of such points can form the base for RCTs to weigh the benefits versus the risks of excessive anticoagulation. Thanks to the current public and political interest in COVID-19, cost issues can be overcome. Large-scale multicentric studies can also recruit in a relatively short period due to the high disease prevalence.

For patients with (multi-)organ failure, a well applied supportive care is as important as a potential antiviral treatment.

Finally, the study may be another proof of the importance of point of care testing like Thrombo-elastography, Critical Care Echocardiography and venous Doppler as a robust tool in the unstable ICU patients.

STUDY STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS

Strengths:

The article answers an important research question.

Short and concise.

Theory generating.

Limitations:

Observational study with a small sample size. Larger observational trials and RCT are needed before translation into clinical practice, to weigh benefit versus risk.

The article did not investigate the underlying coagulation dysfunctional mechanism. Such a point is fundamental to guide both testing and treatment.

Short follow-up period means the incidence may be underestimated.

Abstract

Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged health care systems and physicians worldwide to attempt to provide the best care to their patients with an evolving understanding of this unique pathogen. This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19. This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway. What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected. These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients.

In this paper, we review the current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging evidence for a wide range of cardiovascular disease states with special focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. Our goal is to provide guidance for treatment of the cardiovascular patient with COVID-19 in the face of a rapidly evolving understanding of this virus and its complications.

Preamble:

Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are a major cause of inpatient morbidity and mortality. This is amplified in critically ill patients. COVID-19 patients present special challenges due to rapidly changing clinical status. In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients. The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology. Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations. Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.

Objective:

To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.

Background

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic with over 4.3 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 297,000 deaths as of May 15, 2020. Currently, the United States leads all countries with over 1.3 million confirmed cases and over 82,000 deaths [1]. Disease severity ranges from asymptomatic to critical illness resulting in fatality. Early studies revealed increased prevalence of acute cardiovascular events leading to higher risk of mortality [2-5]. COVID-19 patients may present with hemodynamic instability and increased biomarkers of cardiac injury, specifically troponin and B-Type Natriuretic Peptide. This may be due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocarditis, Type 2 myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The specificity of these biomarkers in this setting is uncertain. Additionally, markedly elevated D-dimer levels are associated with severe illness and high mortality. This has been postulated to be due to micro thrombosis but alternatively may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to an increased inflammatory state. Patients also appear at higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to critical illness, immobility and inflammation.

Managing patients acute antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimens can be difficult without clear consensus on diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are on antiplatelet and anticoagulants for pre-existing conditions when they present to the hospital and thus the balance of further ischemic/thrombotic events vs. bleeding events must be weighed. The margin of error appears to be narrower in patients with multi-system failure where fluctuating organ function can impact drug metabolism.

We aim to provide guidance for management of various clinical scenarios encountered in COVID-19 infected patients recognizing that these recommendations may change given the rapidly evolving understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology.

Clinical Scenarios

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

The diagnosis of ACS in the COVID-19 patient can be challenging given that patients often have elevated troponin levels. Biomarkers are non-specific measures of cardiac injury and may represent a myriad of cardiac conditions including myocardial ischemia secondary to either plaque rupture or demand ischemia,,, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, or coronary spasm. In order to assist with diagnosis and treatment, it is important to take into consideration the patient's clinical presentation, electrocardiogram (ECG), and point of care ultrasound to evaluate ventricular wall motion. Typically, with ACS there is a characteristic rise and fall in troponins which represents myocardial tissue necrosis due to hypoperfusion, as opposed to myocarditis which can often lead to elevated but relatively stable troponin levels that represent ongoing myocardial inflammation and injury. A recent report demonstrated that ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation is down 38% in the United States [6] with growing concern that patients do not seek immediate medical attention due to fear of exposure to COVID-19 leading to missed events.

We recommend in all patients with concern for ACS, non-enteric coated aspirin 162-325 mg should be given immediately if no contraindication exists followed by daily low dose aspirin (81 mg) indefinitely. P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) should be considered in these patients with guidance from cardiology with length of therapy for 1 year in most patients [7-9]. For patients on anticoagulation prior to ACS, triple therapy should be used for the shortest duration possible. A regimen of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) with clopidogrel with short duration of aspirin is now considered standard of care and triple therapy with warfarin should be avoided [10-15].

STEMI specific management

All STEMI patients should receive standard medical therapy including full dose aspirin, high intensity statin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), and nitrates for chest pain if hemodynamics allow. There has been considerable discussion regarding best practices for patients who present with STEMI in the COVID-19 era with debate over fibrinolytic therapy versus primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Based on early experience out of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in China, it was recommended that all STEMIs be treated with thrombolytic therapy given its efficacy andease of administration and to limit health care worker exposure [16]. In the United states, approximately 13% of STEMIs prior to the COVID-19 era had fibrinolytic reperfusion strategies due to inability to access hospitals with PCI capabilities within 120 minutes [17]. To ensure staff safety, there can be considerable system delays in patients who present with STEMI and have concern for COVID-19. These delays may cause patients to no longer receive standard of care primary PCI within the designated door to balloon time of 90 minutes, and the mortality benefit of primary PCI may no longer be significant compared to fibrinolytic therapy [18]. Finally, there is concern about transmission of infection from patient to staff and resources needed for these patients that fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in the COVID-19 patient population [19].

Despite the initial push for fibrinolytic therapy, there is hesitation with this strategy as it can lead to unnecessary use of thrombolytics in the case of 'STEMI-mimicker', patients with COVID-19 who have non-obstructive coronary artery disease on coronary angiography despite STEMI on ECG [20,21]. The use of fibrinolytics in this population would lead to no clinical benefit and potential significant harm. Even in those patients who receive thrombolytics for STEMI, approximately 50% require rescue PCI and thus the benefit of thrombolytics seems to be low in patients where PCI can be performed. Due to these concerns, the current Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) consensus document suggests continuing primary PCI for STEMI patients as the treatment of choice with the use of fibrinolytic therapy only for selected lower risk patients (those with inferior STEMI without RV involvement and those with lateral STEMI without hemodynamic compromise) [20]. The recommendation for primary PCI in the COVID-19 patient was reiterated in a consensus statement from SCAI, American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and a pharmacoinvasive approach should only be considered if primary PCI is not feasible [22]. We agree that primary PCI should remain standard of care if a patient is at a PCI capable hospital. The lack of familiarity with fibrinolytics dosing for many providers, their increased risk of significant bleeding, and the possibility of treating patients without coronary thrombosis makes this a less attractive first line therapy. In patients with whom primary PCI is not possible due to access to a cardiac cath lab, we recommend a pharmacoinvasive approach with fibrinolytic therapy followed by transfer to a PCI capable hospital for possible intervention [23]. If PCI is performed, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and P2Y12 should ideally be continued for one year.

Non-ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (
NSTEMI) specific management:

The diagnosis of type 1 NSTEMI (plaque rupture) is difficult in the COVID-19 era due to the elevated troponin levels in a significant proportion of patients [4]. The true incidence of type 1 myocardial infarctions is not well known and thus COVID-19 positive patients with elevated troponins should be risk stratified to determine the most appropriate management. All patients should receive medical therapy with full dose aspirin, high intensity statin, parental anticoagulation (heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)), beta blocker if hemodynamics allow, and possible nitrate therapy if ongoing chest pain [7]. In patients undergoing early invasive strategy, we recommended using heparin over LMWH as anticoagulant of choice due to ability to titrate the medication and to measure degree of anticoagulation in the cardiac catheterization lab with activated clotting times. Patients who are COVID-19 negative should be considered for early invasive therapy[20]. In patients who are COVID-19 positive or still under investigation, we recommend invasive strategy in patients who have GRACE score > 140 [24] or those with high risk clinical features such as refractory chest pain, unstable arrhythmias, heart failure or hemodynamic instability. In COVID-19 positive patients with low risk NSTEMI, we recommend a delayed invasive approach and upfront medical management [7]. These patients receive less benefit from early-invasive primary PCI compared to high risk NSTEMI. We believe that the risks of resource utilization, risk of virus transmission to hospital workers, and lack of definitive diagnosis is higher than the potential benefit of invasive angiography and potential PCI in this population. We recommend LMWH preferentially over UFH due to the ease of administration, lack of medication titration, and fewer lab draws that could lead health care professionals to unnecessary exposures. In medically treated NSTEMI patients, aspirin (81 mg) with either clopidogrel (75 mg) or ticagrelor (90 mg BID) should be given if no contraindication exists. Prasugrel is not indicated for patients being treated medically for NSTEMI [25]. Consideration for outpatient testing and coronary angiography can be considered in these patients in the future once their infection has resolved in accordance with SCAI/ACC/ACEP recommendations [22].

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD)

Patients with COVID-19 may present on therapy from previous coronary intervention irrespective of their current hospital admission. Data is limited in this patient population, and we therefore rely on established guidelines for antiplatelet recommendations [8]. Patients with COVID-19 may have thrombocytopenia and other coagulopathies similar to DIC which can make the use of anti-platelet agents more challenging. It is important for providers to understand the indication for the patient's antiplatelet therapy in SIHD as it can help guide therapy in those patients at higher bleeding risk. All patients with previous stent placement should be continued on single antiplatelet therapy regardless of indication unless at very high bleeding risk. In patients on therapy with platelet count > 50,000 mm

and at low risk of bleeding, we recommend continuing outpatient anti-platelet therapy for the duration recommended in the ACC/AHA guidelines [8]. In patients with platelet count between 25,000 mm

to 50,000 mm

we recommend continuing aspirin therapy and if platelet count <25,000 mm

discussion with cardiology regarding the ongoing benefits of aspirin therapy (i.e. location of stents, previous ischemic history, size of stents, timing of stent) with risk of bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter

Acute and chronic respiratory illnesses are risk factors for atrial fibrillation [26,27]. COVID-19 patients commonly present with shortness of breath secondary to viral pneumonia with critically ill patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unfortunately, the rate of new atrial fibrillation in these patients is unknown. Management of patients with atrial fibrillation includes oral anticoagulation which is recommended for patients with CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc score of 2 or more in men or 3 or more in women as long as the benefit of anticoagulant outweighs risk of bleeding [28]. In most scenarios, direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are recommended over warfarin due to large randomized controlled trials showing non-inferiority or superiority for stroke reduction and superiority for bleeding risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation [29-32].

In the inpatient setting, there is less guidance on initiation of anticoagulation for new onset atrial fibrillation and decisions to continue outpatient oral anticoagulation can be more difficult due to rapid fluctuations in clinical status, need for invasive procedures, and renal/liver function changes. The risk of endothelial damage, vascular inflammation, and vascular thrombosis appears heightened in severe COVID-19 patients and thus could pose an increased risk of arterial thrombosis in this patient population. The use of UFH or LMWH may be considered in patients with high potential stroke risk and new onset atrial fibrillation; however, heparin drips require constant monitoring and titration of dosing during hospitalization leading to increased nursing exposure to potential COVID-19 patients. In this group, therapeutic enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours could be used instead of unfractionated heparin. Inpatient anticoagulation will be recommended for de novo AF based on the risks of benefits of the individual patients with men with CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc >=2 and women >=3 being most likely to benefit from anticoagulation. In this context, the annual stroke risks are between 5-10% in patients with CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc 5 or 6, and >10% in patients with CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc >=7 [33]. We would recommend LMWH over heparin as long as Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) >= 30 and no need for invasive procedures.

In patients who are established on anticoagulation due to previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, continuing oral anticoagulation should be considered in patients at low risk of clinical decompensation or bleeding. In patients who are critically ill, we recommend holding outpatient oral anticoagulation and consideration of using a parenteral agent (heparin/LMWH). The risks and benefits of stroke vs. bleeding as well as duration of time without oral anticoagulation should be considered in all cases. For patients who do not have prohibitive bleeding risk and CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc score >= 5 or previous thromboembolic event, we would recommend a parental agent with LMWH considered first line therapy if CrCl >= 30 [34]. Patients with mechanical heart valves and atrial fibrillation who require invasive procedures should be bridged with heparin or LMWH [33.35]. The ACC ManageAnticoag app can be used to help providers determine the need for anticoagulation interruption and bridging in case by case scenario. (

Prosthetic heart valves

Despite the concern for increased thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients, there are no published reports of prosthetic valve thrombosis in this patient population. As such, we recommend anticoagulation in accordance with the latest ACC/AHA valvular guidelines. All patients with a mechanical heart valve should continue anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with their previously recommended goal international normalized ratio INR [36,37]. All patients with mechanical valve prostheses should also be continued on 81mg aspirin daily [38], and it is reasonable for patients with bioprosthetic valve prostheses to be continued on ASA 81mg daily [38]. Anticoagulation with DOACs should be avoided in patients with mechanical valve prostheses [39].

In patients on anticoagulation due to mechanical valve, anticoagulation should not be interrupted for low bleeding risk procedures. If, for a procedure, anticoagulation needs to be interrupted, then bridging with LMWH or heparin is reasonable for patients with mechanical mitral valve, mechanical aortic valve with risk factor(s) (atrial fibrillation, low EF, hypercoagulable state or previous VTE), or older generation mechanical aortic valve [40]. We suggest that warfarin only be continued upfront in those patients who are not critically ill or at high bleeding risk. In all others, suggest transition to parental agent with a bridge until warfarin can be resumed.

Stroke

Currently, the most common neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 that should prompt strong consideration of an acute cerebrovascular event include dizziness, headache, focal neurologic deficits, and encephalopathy [41]. In four early studies, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke complicated COVID-19 infection in about 6% of patients at a median 10 days after symptom onset and the incidence, particular stroke due to large vessel occlusion, continues to rise in the United States [42-45]. In addition to common cardiovascular comorbidities in the elderly COVID-19 positive population, mechanisms for ischemic stroke in infected patients of all age groups include hypercoagulability from pro-inflammatory state, embolism from virus-related cardiac injury, and infection-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. Intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke may also occur due to possible coagulopathy, specifically thrombocytopenia, in the severely ill, fluctuating blood pressures due to viral-binding to ACE 2 receptors [46], and potential interactions between anticoagulants and medications now commonly used for COVID-19 patients (
Table 1
).

Anti-Coagulant and Anti-Platelet Therapy in the COVID-19 Patient: A Best Practices Quality Initiative Across a Large Health System

Published online:

Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) head is the appropriate initial imaging in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms particularly prior to initiation of antithrombotic agents. While most serum studies are not required prior to emergent IV-tPA use based on guidelines, it may be reasonable to await results of coagulation studies and complete blood count in critically ill COVID-19 suspected or positive patients prior to thrombolytic administration. Patients with large vessel occlusion remain eligible for endovascular therapy despite infection.

Antithrombotic recommendations for secondary prevention of stroke in the suspected or positive COVID-19 patient are currently unchanged from the general population assuming absence of coagulopathy and prothrombotic state. For ischemic stroke due to small and large vessel atherosclerotic disease as well as embolic strokes of undetermined source, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/dipyridamole remains the appropriate first line therapy [47,48]. Dual antiplatelet therapy should be reserved for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease [49], certain carotid cases, recent stenting, and patients with recent minor stroke or high risk TIA [50].

Outcomes in available COVID-19 patient data do not suggest clear benefit over risk of therapeutic anticoagulation for primary stroke prevention. However, assuming low risk of hemorrhagic conversion, therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH is frequently initiated for secondary stroke prevention in the critically ill with significantly elevated D-dimer and no other clear etiology of ischemic stroke. In addition to patients with atrial fibrillation, consider anticoagulation with UFH/LMWH, warfarin, or DOACs in patients with ischemic strokes that are embolic appearing with cardiac etiology, non-occlusive thrombi, recurrent ischemic strokes, atypical intracranial stenosis, venous sinus thrombosis, extracranial dissection with ischemia, and pro-thrombotic state [51]. Minimize use of triple therapy to avoid intracranial hemorrhagic complications. The appropriate timeframe to initiate anticoagulation in the ischemic stroke patient remains heavily individualized based on age, comorbidities, stroke size and location, imaging characteristics, and medication choice. The decision to initiate antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19 positive patients with acute neurologic symptoms should be made in conjunction with a neurologist.

Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)

Stable, Chronic PAD

Peripheral arterial disease is a common cardiovascular disorder that is highly under-recognized with significant cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and quality of life impairment. In patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, anti-platelet medication with either aspirin (75-325 mg per day) or clopidogrel (75 mg per day) is recommended as first line therapy [52]. The use of dual anti-platelet therapy is beneficial only in those patients who have undergone revascularization [52]. Patients should remain on these medications throughout their hospitalization unless high bleeding risk.

Acute Limb Ischemia

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is defined as <2 weeks of severe hypoperfusion of the limb characterized by features of pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia, paresthesias, and paralysis [53]. Patients who present to the hospital with ALI should be emergently evaluated to assess limb viability and systemically anticoagulated with heparin unless contraindicated. In early single center retrospective studies, the incidence of ALI in COVID-19 patients appears to be higher than the general public and includes patients with no traditional risk factors [54.55]. The success of revascularization was also decreased felt to be secondary to the virus induced hypercoagulable state [54].

In patients with COVID-19, it is important to remain hypervigilant for signs and symptoms of ALI. Emergent consultation with vascular surgery should be obtained and early initiation of parental anticoagulation is paramount due to the hypercoagulable state observed in some patients. We suggest that patients undergo limb salvage procedures in accordance with standardized guidelines due to high risk of morbidity and mortality without acute intervention. Acro-ischemia has been described in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 pneumonia and, despite treatment with LMWH, there was no clinical improvement and there was a high rate of mortality [56]. In these patients, a palliative approach should be considered.

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

Recent data suggests a high rate of VTE in the hospitalized, critically ill COVID-19 patient [57,58]. The mechanism by which these patients are developing VTE at significant rates have been hypothesized including immobility, severe inflammatory response, and coagulopathy including DIC. Decision algorithms of testing patients for asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE as well as treatment of VTE are not well defined. Patients should be risk stratified (high, intermediate, or low risk) on presentation to help guide therapy [59,60].

For COVID-19 patients who present with or develop acute VTE during hospitalization, we recommend treating with anticoagulation if no contraindication exists. For all patients with symptomatic PE, we recommend activating the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) to provide interdisciplinary care and make individualized decisions based on the patient's clinical status, co-morbidities, and hospital factors [60,61]. In patients with high-risk PE, we recommend systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in patients with low bleeding risk or those who deteriorate after initial anticoagulation (i.e. development of worsening hypoxia, tachycardia, RV failure) [60,62,63]. In patients at high bleeding risk, the use of catheter directed mechanical thrombolysis or surgical removal should be considered in consultation with the PERT team [64].

In the intermediate risk patient, debate remains over the best treatment. Risk calculators such as the PESI or BOVA score can help further risk stratify these patients to help guide therapy [65,66]. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment for this population and we suggest the use of parental anticoagulation with heparin or enoxaparin instead of a DOAC due to potential decompensation [60,67,68]. Enoxaparin is preferred if CrCl is >= 30. The use of catheter directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy for intermediate risk PE should be made on a case by case basis with guidance from the PERT team. Due to the risk of infectivity, there should be a higher threshold to perform invasive procedures that have not been shown to improve mortality [64]. Once patients have stabilized, we recommend the use of DOAC over the use of warfarin or LMWH therapy [60,62].

In the low risk patient, we recommend treatment with a DOAC without the need of parental anticoagulation (apixaban or rivaroxaban) to avoid increasing length of stay.

The use of inferior vena cava filters should not be considered for routine use and only considered in those patients who have absolute contraindications for anticoagulation with clinically relevant VTE [62]. In a patient who requires an IVC filter, anticoagulation should still be restarted once the bleeding risk has passed.

VTE Prophylaxis

The incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the ICU has been shown to be at least 25-40% in observational studies [57,58]. This increased rate of thrombotic complications appears to be related to a hypercoagulable state similar to DIC or thrombotic microangiopathy yet with unique differences including the appearance of a positive lupus anticoagulant in patients [51,69,70]. In order to attempt to decrease the rates of thrombotic complications, preventative measures should be used whenever possible [71]. Heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux are all recommended for VTE prophylaxis by the American College of Chest Physicians [72]. One retrospective study of critically ill COVID-19 patients with D-dimers > 6x ULN compared UFH or LMWH plus antiviral therapy versus no pharmacologic prophylaxis plus antiviral therapy. The combination therapy of pharmacologic plus antiviral group had a significantly decreased 28 day mortality [73]. LMWH was preferentially used in this study due to its previously reported anti-inflammatory effect. Another retrospective trial in critically ill patients in China confirmed lower mortality in those patients who were treated with pharmacologic prophylaxis, yet stated that Asian populations have a low incidence of VTE and thus higher doses of anticoagulation may be necessary in other populations [74].

There remains concern throughout the medical community that in the most critically ill patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis is not enough to reduce the risk of thrombosis. A French cohort of ICU patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis found a high prevalence of thrombotic complications including PE, stroke, circuit clotting of continuous renal replacement therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with minimal bleeding risk suggesting the need for higher doses of prophylactic anticoagulation in this patient population [70]. In another retrospective study, mechanically vented patients were found to have a significantly decreased risk of mortality if treated with full dose anticoagulation compared to those not on anticoagulation, yet this mortality benefit was not seen in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital [75]. The use of higher dose thromboprophylaxis or full dose anticoagulation is currently being investigated in multiple randomized control trials (NCT04372589, NCT04367831, NCT04345949, and NCT04366960).

We recommend that all patients on admission be assessed for risk of VTE. For patients with platelet counts greater than 25,000, we recommend using pharmacologic prophylaxis for all COVID-19 positive patients if no contraindication exists. While anecdotal and retrospective data may support higher doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis in critically ill patients, there is considerable risk of bleeding in these populations and thus without higher level evidence we remain hesitant to adopt these practices. As such, we continue to recommend standard dose pharmacologic prophylaxis with an understanding that our recommendations may change as data continues to evolve.

Enoxaparin is the preferred agent for patients with a CrCl >= 30 ml/min. For those with impaired renal function, heparin can be used as an alternative agent with dosing regimen based on patient weight. For heparin dosing, patients <50 kg use 5,000 units q12 hours, for patients 50-120 kg we recommend 5,000 units Q8 hours, for >120kg we recommend 7,500 units Q8 hours. For enoxaparin dosing, we recommend 30 mg Qday for those <40 kg, 40 mg Qday for patients 40-120 kg, and 40 mg twice a day for patients > 120 kg. We recommend mechanical prophylaxis in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis for all ICU patients without contraindication. For patients that are unable to be on pharmacologic prophylaxis due to low platelets or active bleeding we recommend mechanical prophylaxis. (

Venn diagram illustrating the overlap in patient risk factors and co-morbidities to determine the type of anticoagulation

Critically ill patients who survive to discharge are still at increased risk of thromboembolic events [76]. Given that thromboembolic events seem to be elevated in the COVID-19 population, this risk may be even higher. We recommend that all patients be assessed for VTE risk at discharge for consideration of extended VTE prophylaxis. Multiple studies pre-COVID-19 have shownthe benefit of extended prophylaxis for high risk patients following discharge. The decreased incidence of thrombotic events is at the expense of a slight increase in bleeding. Multiple agents have shown efficacy with extended prophylaxis including enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, and betrixaban [77-79]. We recommend that patients should be risk assessed for VTE and bleeding on discharge for extended prophylaxis using the IMPROVEDD for VTE and IMPROVE Bleeding risk indices [80-83]. The patient should have a creatinine clearance and liver function panel in addition to platelet count (>25,000 mm
3
) prior to initiation of extended prophylaxis. We preferentially recommend rivaroxaban 10mg daily for 6 weeks for extended prophylaxis. Enoxaparin 40 mg Qday subcutaneously can be used as an alternative agent if the CrCl >= 30 ml/min. If patients are unable to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis, we recommend knee high compression stockings (15-20 or 20-30mmHg) and encourage ambulation. Patients should be educated on the symptoms and signs of DVT/PE and report such events to their primary care provider.

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

DIC can be seen in hospitalized patients with severe illness [84]. It can accompany the acute respiratory failure and multi-organ failure from COVID-19 and is associated with poor prognosis [85]. Yet, further studies suggest that while similar to DIC, the coagulopathy of COVID-19 has distinct features with only mild thrombocytopenia and normal fibrinogen levels early in the course [2,86]. There also appear to be similarities to thrombotic microangiopathy with elevated LDH and ferritin levels [87]. These coagulation abnormalities appear to promote the hypercoagulable hypothesis of COVID-19 which has been further suggested by autopsy reports showing micro thrombosis of the lungs and various other organs [69].

The optimal initial approach to DIC or DIC like coagulopathy is to treat underlying causes, and in this case to support O
2
and CO
2
exchange, metabolic functions, and possibly use anti-viral agents and anti-cytokine release syndrome agents. Clinically, close attention for these patients should be directed to unexpected bleeding or thrombosis. In addition to clinical monitoring, lab tests to monitor for the development and progression of DIC are the CBC, PT and aPTT, and fibrinogen. Serial comparisons of the labs are essential as development of DIC during hospitalization is a poor prognostic indicator [85]. D-dimer, while not specific for DIC has also been shown independently to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality when significantly elevated [2,85,86].

Despite the incidence of DIC being a poor prognostic indicator, the treatment of these patients remains the previous standard of care. In accordance with the guidance from the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), these patients should be treated with prophylactic dose enoxaparin if no contraindication exists [88]. There is no role for therapeutic anticoagulation in DIC, in the absence of an acute thrombotic event.

While bleeding in COVID-19 patients remains less common than thrombosis, bleeding risk increases as the platelet count goes below 50,000 mm
3
, the PT and PTT rise to > 1.4 X ULN, or when fibrinogen falls below 100 mg/dl. There is no role for giving blood products to correct lab abnormalities in the absence of bleeding [89]. If bleeding occurs, blood product(s) should be given to replace the depleted components. Factor VIIa and prothrombin complex concentrate use are discouraged, as the risk of serious thrombosis is high.

Drug-Drug Interactions

In the COVID-19 era there is an influx of drugs aimed to improve patient's morbidity and mortality. The only FDA approved therapy at this time for COVID-19 is remdesivir, and there remains over 100 pharmacological trials on clinical-trials.gov attempting to find further treatment for this disease [90]. The effect of these medications on anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants is important for the individualized patient and the prescriber. Pathways that are most important for identifying drug-drug interactions appear mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and/or transporter permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). The most common medications being used include hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab which may affect the efficacy of antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

P2Y12 inhibitors are commonly used in a wide spectrum of cardiovascular disease states as described above. Their interactions with treatments for COVID-19 are not well known and rely on package inserts and anecdotal experience. The only medication with significant known interactions with P2Y12 inhibitors is lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor previously used for treatment of HIV. Early studies in patients with COVID-19 have found no decrease in morbidity or mortality with this medication combination [91], yet ongoing trials continue to look at the impact of this combination on patients with COVID-19. It is a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism and has significant effects on clopidogrel and ticagrelor, yet no significant effect on prasugrel. Inhibition of CYP3A4 in patients taking clopidogrel can decrease its efficacy, however, inhibition of CYP3A4 leads to increased effects of ticagrelor and thus neither is recommended to be administered in patients on lopinavir/ritonavir [92,93].

Despite advances in DOACs for reducing systemic thromboembolism and systemic bleeding compared to warfarin, DOACs have drug-drug interactions that must be considered in all patients. CYP3A4 is important for the metabolism of apixaban (20-25%) and rivaroxaban (18%) with no significant effect on dabigatran and edoxaban while P-gp is important mediator for apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. The FDA recommends avoiding concurrent use of apixaban and rivaroxaban with inducers of P-gp or CYP3A4 [94]. There is limited data on the in vivo effects of these medications with DOAC concentrations and unless explicitly known we do not have recommendations regarding avoiding or dose changes of these medications.
Table 1
summarizes the interactions between the investigational drugs and commonly prescribed DOACs. Further drug-drug interactions between DOACs and commonly used medications can be found in the EHRA practical guidelines [95]. Hydroxychloroquine, used primarily in auto-immune disease, has not been found to interact with CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein. Azithromycin is an inhibitor of P-gp and thus could increase the serum concentration of dabigatran especially in conjunction with other cardiac P-gp inhibitors such as amiodarone. It is not recommended to decrease dabigatran dosing. However, patients on edoxaban should only be prescribed the 30 mg dose for VTE.Lopinavir/ritonavir are known strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and thus could have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of all DOACs leading to increased concentration and potential bleeds. The European Heart Rhythm Association practical guidelines suggests that DOACs should not be given in patients taking ritonavir [95]. However, package insert of apixaban recommends dose reduction by 50% and should not be co-administered if patient is on low dose apixaban (2.5 mg BID). We suggest to avoid DOACs in patients with whom lopinavir/ritonavir is being prescribed. Tocilizumab is known to decrease serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates and thus could decrease the effectiveness of apixaban or rivaroxaban. Finally, remdesivir has little pharmacokinetic data available although it is believed that there are no significant clinical interactions with CYP3A4 enzyme.

Conclusions

COVID-19 has challenged our thinking about the management of critically ill patients. The mechanisms of this disease and its complications continues to be elucidated. That being said the principles of managing these patients are built on the foundations of evidence-based medicine in severely ill patients. There is a narrow therapeutic index between prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis in these patients and risk of bleeding. This document can be used to help guide providers to treat cardiovascular patients at high risk during this pandemic (
Figure 2
). Only by adhering to the principles of practicing what we know and maintaining openness to what we don't can we stand up to the greatest challenge of our professional lives.

1. COVID-19 patients have much in common with other critically ill patients where there may be a narrow margin for AC and APT of benefit (preventing thrombotic events) and risk (bleeding).

2. The rationale for AC should be carefully examined in all inpatients, balancing risk and benefit. For example: a patient on AC with CHA
2
DS
2
-VASc of 1 for men and 2 for women. Point of care risk calculators and apps to assist in evaluating the risk and benefit should be used when available.

3. In COVID-19 confirmed or expected patients, it is reasonable to continue outpatient anticoagulation unless they become critically ill in the ICU or if they have invasive procedures planned.

4. If interrupted, bridging should not be offered in low risk thrombosis patients.

5. Routine use of aspirin increases bleeding risk by as much as 50% and benefit should be carefully assessed.

6. Prolonged DAPT beyond 6 months for elective stenting and beyond a year for ACS should be examined, balancing risk and benefit.

7. Warfarin based triple therapy for patients with stenting and AF is inferior to DOAC based regimen with P2Y12 and short duration aspirin.

8. Decision to bridge either with UFH or LMWH in a COVID-19 patient exposes nursing to a greater degree. This is not worthwhile in a low thrombotic risk patient.

9. When there is the potential for significant drug-drug interactions, consultation with pharmacy is invaluable.

10. Careful consideration is required in weighing the risks and benefits of any intervention not only to the COVID-19 confirmed or expected patient, but also to the health care workers who are directly involved in patient care. Special consideration should be given when possible to limiting health care worker exposure to COVID-19.

Abstract

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the current devastating worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity. In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID-19.

Background

COVID-19 infection has been reported to be related with an increased risk of thrombotic complications because of the hypercoagulability state and inflammation. At the moment, no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID-19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft.

Methods and results

A 67-year-old male patient, who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft 6 years before, was admitted to the emergency department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Owing to the progressive impairment of the respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission, the day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died on the arrival in the radiological suite.

Conclusions

Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.

Abstract

There is some evidence that Covid 19 pneumonia is associated with prothrombotic status and increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Over a two-week period we admitted in our Unit 25 patients with Covid-19 pneumonia, of these pulmonary embolism was diagnosed using computed tomography angiography in 7. We report on clinical and biochemical features of these patients. They were all males, with a mean age of 70.3 years (range 58-84); traditional risk factors for venous thromboembolism were identified in the majority of patients with pulmonary embolism, however not differently from those without pulmonary embolism. Clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism patients was usually characterized by persistence or worsening of respiratory symptoms, with increasing oxygen requirement. D-dimer levels were several fold higher than the upper threshold of normal; in patients in whom PE was recognized
during
hospital stay, a rapid and relevant increase of D-dimer levels was observed.

Abstract

We report a case of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) in a young patient with Covid-19 infection that was on therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban for deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of Covid-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 ug/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 ug/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 ug/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 ug/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 ug/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date.

Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in Covid-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to Covid-19. Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in Covid-19 remain unclear.."

Objective

The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection who had presented with and been treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

Methods

We performed a single-center, observational cohort study. The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database. For the present series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) re-occlusion or major amputation or death within 24 hours. The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (<=30 days) and late (>=30 days) survival, postoperative (<=30 days) complications, and limb salvage.

Results

We evaluated the data from 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19. For the period from January to March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly greater than that for the same months in 2019 (23 of 141 [16.3%] vs 3 of 163 [1.8%];
P
< .001)]. Of the 20 included patients, 18 were men (90%) and two were women (10%). Their mean age was 75 +- 9 years (range, 62-95 years). All 20 patients already had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%). Revascularization was successful in 12 of the 17 (70.6%). Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs 83.3%;
P
= .622), no patient who had received intravenous heparin required reintervention. Of the 20 patients, eight (40%) had died in the hospital. The patients who had died were significantly older (81 +- 10 years vs 71 +- 5 years;
P
= .008). The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs 57.1%;
P
= .042).

Conclusions

In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardy region. Successful revascularization was lower than expected, which we believed was due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state. The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival.

Sparks, Swapnil Hiremath, Andrew …","The most common reported reasons for intensive care unit admission for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are either hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation or hypotension requiring vasopressor support. Data on AKI are either lacking
1
or only reporting incidence on the basis of case series and retrospective studies.
2
In this Perspective, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI.

Understandably relevant information that normally would be part of clinical descriptions and research publications has not been collected because of the magnitude and accelerated pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of great relevance is a preprint in
medRxiv
reporting a 23% AKI incidence among 85 patients (over 60% in high-risk patients). The authors analyzed kidney histology from autopsies of six patients who had AKI showing severe acute tubular necrosis with lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, but it is not clear from this report if these patients had actually developed cortical necrosis (B. Diao, C.H. Wang, R.S. Wang, Z.Q. Feng, Y.J. Tan, H.M. Wang,
et al.
: Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection [preprint posted online April 10, 2020].
medRxiv
doi:10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120
). An important report on autopsy findings from deceased patients with COVID-19 again demonstrated prominent acute proximal tubular injury, but also peritubular erythrocyte aggregation and glomerular fibrin thrombi with ischemic collapse.
3
This paper also reported endothelial damage, hemosiderin deposition, pigment casts related to rhabdomyolysis, and inflammation. Notably, some of these patients lacked evidence of AKI as detected by routine measures (creatinine and/or BUN), highlighting the possibility of substantial subclinical kidney injury.

Recent clinical and autopsy reports of COVID-19 from China and the United States confirm increased clotting and disseminated intravascular coagulation with small vessel thrombosis and pulmonary infarction.
4
Further, elevated d-dimer and low platelet levels correlated with worse outcomes.
4
We are aware that some patients with COVID-19 manifest evidence of microangiopathy in other organ systems, such as splenic infarction or presenting symptoms of loin pain and hematuria suggesting renal infarction. Numerous observations by treating physicians attest that there is increased occurrence of circuit clotting in patients with COVID-19 undergoing dialysis. COVID-19 is also associated with increased myocardial injury that mimics myocardial infarction, possibly from myocarditis and microangiopathy.
5
Thus, it is conceivable that the hypercoagulable state that appears to be a characteristic complication of severe COVID-19 could, in some cases, foster the evolution of acute tubular necrosis to cortical necrosis and, therefore, irreversible kidney failure.

Also of interest is the finding that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was observed in tubular structures in the kidneys from the six patients examined, and nucleocapsid protein-positive inclusion bodies were also observed in the cytoplasm (B. Diao, C.H. Wang, R.S. Wang, Z.Q. Feng, Y.J. Tan, H.M. Wang,
et al.
: Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection [preprint posted online April 10, 2020].

). Su
et al.

similarly observed the presence of virus-like particles in podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells by electron microscopy, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibody stained renal tubular epithelia positive, but the specificity of the antibody used needs to be established. Although, as far as we know, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, has not been detected in the kidney, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect human kidney tubules and induce cytoplasmic renal tubular inclusions, a feature observed in other virus-associated nephropathies. Thus, although AKI may be attributable to hypotension and decreased kidney perfusion secondary to hemodynamic or hemostatic factors or associated sepsis, one needs to consider that viral infection of the kidneys with viral replication directly in kidney parenchyma also plays a role.

The main binding site for SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, is the ACE2 protein, which is expressed in the kidney much more than the lungs.
9
,
10
ACE2 is expressed on the brush border apical membrane of the proximal tubule, where it colocalizes with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and is also present at lower levels in podocytes.
10
It is conceivable that the virus could enter the kidney by invading podocytes first, and thus gain access to the tubular fluid and subsequently bind to ACE2 in the proximal tubule. In primary human airway epithelia, ACE2 is expressed apically, and SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly occurs on the apical surface, but infection can occur on the basolateral surface at low efficiency.
11
Coronavirus entry into host target cells also requires fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. Fusion-activated SARS-CoV peptides are created by specific proteolytic cleavage of the S proteins, in a step called ""priming."" As a consequence, cell infectivity not only depends on ACE2 expression, but is also governed by types of proteases found in a given cell type. In the kidney, Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)
12
-
14
(
Figure 1
), which primes the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, is robustly expressed in the distal nephron rather than the proximal tubule. It remains to be determined if other TMPRSS in the proximal tubule can mediate the priming step, such as TMPRSS 4, 5, or 9. Alternatively, tropism of SARS-CoV-2 might be expanded by the unique furin cleavage site in the Spike protein that is processed during biogenesis.
14

Any effect of proteinuria, hyperinflammation, or tubular injury on proximal tubular ACE2 expression or SARS-CoV-2 viral entry is currently unknown. Viral replication in podocytes and the ensuing damage could in theory account for the proteinuria that has been reported in patients with COVID-19.
2
Further, COVID-19-associated hemophagocytic macrophage activation and microangiopathy could also cause AKI and podocyte damage. Of interest, cases of COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy have been described.
15

Regardless of direct viral infection of the kidney, AngII is likely increased in the context of acute lung injury
16
and there is evidence that ACE2 is downregulated in AKI. This may lead to type 1 angiotensin receptor activation as well as decreased angiotensin (1-7) formation and subsequent worsening of AKI. This is particularly important in subpopulations of patients who have CKD, especially those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). ACE2 and ACE mRNA and protein expression are altered in mouse models of DKD and in patients with DKD.
10
,
17
Thus, patients with CKD, especially those with DKD, who develop COVID-19 may be at higher risk of AKI because of baseline upregulation of the ACE and downregulation of ACE2, a combination that primes a proinflammatory (including complement activation) and profibrotic state in the kidneys.

Interestingly, a recent study described single-cell transcriptome analysis in 15 normal human kidney samples.
18
In this study, the proportions of kidney cells expressing ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding site, and proteases of the TMPRSS family were compared between occidental and Asian individuals.
18
Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 and kidney disease-related genes was higher in occidental donors relative to Asian donors. This would suggest that the susceptibility to kidney injury from coronavirus infection might be higher in individuals of occidental rather than Asian descent. We are not aware, however, of data supporting this possibility.

Despite the very limited information on kidney involvement in COVID-19, AKI appears to involve a complex process driven by virus-mediated injury, cytokine storm, AngII pathway activation, dysregulation of complement, hypercoagulation, and microangiopathy interacting with common and known risk factors for AKI (
Figure 2
). There is paucity of data regarding clinical and laboratory characteristics of AKI in patients with COVID-19. We urge that further studies describing and analyzing the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 include appropriate indices of kidney function and diagnosis of AKI in their analyses, including kidney injury markers, urine microscopy, quantified urine protein, urine output, and urine electrolytes. Markers of macrophage activation, coagulation, microangiopathy, and complement activation, as well as kidney imaging and need for KRT (with relevant details), are important data needed to further our understanding of AKI pathophysiology associated with COVID-19. Rates of reversibility of, or partial improvement in, kidney function and any kidney biopsy results (including immunofluorescence and electron microscopy) should be reported. In the rush to report medical complications of COVID-19, we are missing valuable clinical information. Speculation about specific interventions would not be appropriate until we obtain appropriate information. We advocate for a complete and standardized appraisal of the clinical and laboratory picture so that preventative and therapeutic strategies for AKI can be appropriately designed and implemented.

Rates of thromboembolic events and use of augmented thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 are therefore the subject of significant interest. However, the clinical manifestations of this procoagulant tendency are poorly defined. In this report, we describe two cases of major occlusive arterial events in previously asymptomatic individuals with confirmed COVID-19.

The first, a 60-year-old male, presented to hospital with sudden loss of sensation and power in both legs. Prior to this he reported a dry cough, fever and general malaise for 2 weeks prior to hospital presentation, but no pre-existing symptoms of peripheral vascular disease. Examination revealed signs of bilateral acute lower limb ischemia with tachypnoea and tachycardia. Electrocardiogram was normal.

Arterial thrombotic events in patients with Covid-19. A and B: Computerised tomography (CT) of the chest (A) and angiography (B) in a 60-year-old man with cough, fever and leg paralysis. An abrupt occlusion of the infrarenal aorta is evident on angiography (white arrowhead, B) C and D: CT findings in a 75-year-old man with breathlessness and abdominal pain. Intraluminal thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta (red arrow) and superior mesenteric artery (red arrowhead) are indicated.

The second patient, a 75-year-old male with no comorbidities, attended the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting for 2 days, along with worsening of the cough and dyspnoea which he had experienced for the preceding 2 weeks. On arrival, his oxygen saturations were 88% on room air but the remainder of his observations were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis (18*1 x 10
9
/l), lymphopenia (0*9 x 10
9
/l) and a mild thrombocytosis (497 x 10
9
/l). D-dimer levels were elevated (3*2 mg/l) but troponin T, renal function and liver function were normal. Chest imaging was indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig
1C
). On CT angiography, intraluminal thrombus was present in the descending thoracic aorta with embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (Fig
1D
) but no evidence of atherosclerosis. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was commenced but the patient developed worsening abdominal symptoms and underwent laparotomy, requiring resection of 150 cm of ischemic small bowel.

These cases illustrate that the prothrombotic sequela of Covid-19 are not confined to the venous circulation, and macrovascular thrombi in the arterial circulation can occur in susceptible individuals during SARS-CoV-2 infection even in the absence of overt features of disseminated intravascular coagulation or severe respiratory manifestations.

Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-V-2) in December 2019, multiple characteristics have been reported, as our understanding of this new disease unfolds. One such association is its tendency to cause thromboembolic events, particularly venous thromboembolism (1,2). In a four-week period during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23 patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE). Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients. Although D-dimer tended to rise during the hospitalization relative to the control group, the results were inconsistent, and there were no other meaningful distinguishing features between the groups at the time of admission.

To rapidly communicate information on the global clinical effort against Covid-19, the
Journal
has initiated a series of case reports that offer important teaching points or novel findings. The case reports should be viewed as observations rather than as recommendations for evaluation or treatment. In the interest of timeliness, these reports are evaluated by in-house editors, with peer review reserved for key points as needed.

We describe five patients in our intensive care units (ICUs) who had confirmed Covid-19. All five patients presented to the ICUs between March 23 and April 4, 2020. Four of the five patients had profound hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest with acute right ventricular failure, and one had severe hemodynamic instability without cardiac arrest. The clinical scenario and echocardiographic findings in one representative patient are provided (see the
Video
, available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org).

A 42-year-old man with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 34 and a history of asthma presented to the hospital with hypoxemic respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation. Testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive. Other laboratory values on admission of this patient (Patient 1) are summarized in
Table 1
; these values were notable for normal levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin, and
d
-dimer. The patient did not have a personal or family history of hypercoagulability and had received enoxaparin for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Previous outpatient echocardiographic findings showed a normal biventricular size and function.

On ICU day 8, the patient became acutely hypotensive and had rapid progression to cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation with administration of epinephrine and intravenous thrombolytics, and spontaneous circulation returned. Echocardiography showed acute right ventricular dilatation with impaired systolic function (see

), and subsequent computed tomography confirmed the presence of thromboembolism obstructing the left pulmonary artery.

Over a 48-hour period, five patients who were admitted to ICUs within our hospital system had profound hemodynamic instability due to the development of acute cor pulmonale (clinical details are summarized in Table 1). Cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity occurred in four patients, and three of these patients had died as of May 1. In one patient, acute cor pulmonale developed without cardiac arrest; this patient's condition improved with thrombolytic therapy. At the time of hemodynamic instability, one patient was receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with intravenous heparin according to a non-citrate-based anticoagulation protocol, and the remaining patients were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation.

Myocardial dysfunction and hypercoagulability have been reported in patients with Covid-19; however, the true incidence and clinical implications of these events remain unclear.

Although acute pulmonary thromboembolism was the most likely cause of right ventricular failure in these patients, this was not definitively confirmed in all cases. Acute cor pulmonale causing obstructive shock should be included in the differential diagnosis in critically ill patients with Covid-19.

The role of thrombolytics and advanced management options such as extracorporeal life support for hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest requires further investigation."

Abstract

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has created diagnostic uncertainty with regards to distinguishing this infection from pulmonary embolism (PE). Although there appears to be an increased incidence of thromboembolic disease in patients with COVID-19 infection, recommendations regarding anticoagulation are lacking. We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with clinically significant venous and arterial thromboemboli in the setting of COVID-19 infection requiring tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)."

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from 3/27/2020 to 4/10/2020 who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed and salient findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed.

Conclusion

Bowel abnormalities and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of inpatients with COVID-19. Patients who went to laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small vessel thrombosis.

Summary

Bowel abnormalities, including ischemia, and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of inpatients with COVID-19.

Key Results

# 33% of inpatients with COVID-19 had abdominal imaging and 17% had cross-sectional imaging. Imaging was associated with age (OR 1.03 per year increase) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 17.3).

# 31% of CTs showed bowel wall abnormalities. Signs of late ischemia were seen on 20% of CTs in ICU patients (2.7% of ICU patients), with pathologic correlation suggesting small vessel thrombosis.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents an ongoing global threat. Common clinical features reported in early confirmed infections included fever, cough, and myalgias or fatigue (
1
,
2
). But as testing capacity and case numbers have increased worldwide, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite have been increasingly recognized (
3
-
5
). Although lung injury is most common, liver injury of uncertain etiology has been observed in patients with COVID-19, with increased frequency in severe cases (
6
).

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to gain access to cells via surface expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (
7
). Thus, tissues with high levels of ACE2 expression are assumed to be susceptible to direct infection (
8
). ACE2 surface expression is most abundant in lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, and vascular endothelium (
9
). The large amount of ACE2 surface expression in the gastrointestinal tract and, less so, biliary epithelium have been offered as possible explanations of GI symptoms and liver injury (
10
,
11
). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in stool samples of a substantial proportion of infected patients (
12
-
14
).

Several reports have evaluated chest imaging findings in COVID-19, leading to a greater understanding of pathogenesis in the lung (
15
,
16
). Despite the widening recognition of abdominal manifestations, to our knowledge, corresponding abdominal imaging findings have not yet been reported. Imaging findings may help understand abdominal phenomena in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, radiologists should be aware of abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to explore abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19.

Materials and Methods

Patients and Study Design

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study performed at a large quaternary care academic institution, with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and requirement of informed consent waived by the IRB. All data were collected in compliance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All aspects of the study were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

We included all adult patients (>18 years) consecutively admitted at our institution over a two-week period (03/27/2020 to 4/10/2020) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No patients were excluded. We queried our electronic radiology database on our Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) to identify all abdominal imaging examinations performed in these patients from seven days prior to admission to 04/21/2020. The patients underwent abdominal imaging studies including radiography, US, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and MRI.

Imaging Acquisition

All CT scans were performed on 64-slice or 128-slice multidetector CT scanners. The CT scans were performed with (n=35) or without (n=7) intravenous contrast media. In patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT, axial acquisition of the abdomen and pelvis in the portal venous phase was performed after injection of 80-120 cc of iodinated contrast media (Omnipaque 350 mgI/ml, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 3-5 ml/sec followed by a 40 ml saline chaser at the same rate. Axial images were reconstructed at 5mm thickness with an interval of 5 mm. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were created at 3mm thickness. All ultrasound examinations were performed by a registered sonographer (1-30 years of experience).

Our limited right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) protocol includes evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, central biliary tree, and portal vein. Cine and static gray scale and color doppler images were acquired and sent to our picture archiving and communications system (PACS) for interpretation by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist (1-47 years of experience). Radiographs were performed in the supine position with scan coverage extending from above the dome of the diaphragm to below the pubic symphysis. The abdominal MRI examination (n=1) was a liver MRI with gadolinium performed on a 3T MRI.

Data Collection and Image Analysis

All cross-sectional imaging studies (US, CT, MRI) were interpreted in a clinical setting by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist (1-47 years of experience). Images were independently reviewed, an average of 13 days after the initial report, by a board-certified radiologist (RB, abdominal imaging fellow, 5 years of experience including training), who was blinded to clinical data. Discrepancies with initial interpretation reached consensus in consultation with a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist (AK, 8 years of experience). Since assessment of certain features can be subjective, the following criteria were adhered to when reviewing images: (i) bowel wall thickening on CT was defined as single wall thickness >3 mm in distended loops and >5mm in collapsed loops; (ii) fluid filled colon was defined as homogeneous dependent low attenuation colonic content; (iii) gallbladder distension was defined as a transverse dimension >4 cm; (iv) gallbladder sludge was defined as echogenic non-shadowing debris in the gallbladder; (v) gallbladder wall thickening was defined as single wall thickness > 3 mm in an adequately distended gallbladder on sonographic images specifically interrogating the gallbladder; (vi) fatty liver on ultrasound was defined as increased echogenicity of the hepatic parenchyma obscuring periportal echogenicity +/- diaphragmatic echogenicity. These thresholds were intentionally set to be more specific than sensitive to reduce false positive observations.

Following review of imaging studies, surgery and pathology notes were collected from electronic medical records and reviewed by two radiologists (RB, AK). Surgical findings were verified in consultation with a critical care surgeon (GV, 24 years of experience). Pathology findings were verified by a gastrointestinal pathologist, who reviewed pathologic images (JM, 20 years of experience). Demographic and clinical data (presence of GI symptoms, ICU admission) were collected from electronic medical records by independent investigators (AS, first year radiology resident; MDL, second year radiology resident; or DEC, third year medical student), who were blinded to imaging findings. Presence of GI symptoms at presentation was defined as documentation of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain on the clinical note at initial hospital evaluation. All data were compiled and analyzed by two radiologists (RB, AK).""

Statistical Analysis

Demographic, clinical, and imaging data from patients admitted to the ICU were compared to other inpatients using univariable statistical tests including independent t-test, chi-square test, and fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for an association between imaging parameters (number of abdominal imaging studies, cholestasis, bowel wall abnormality) and demographic/clinical data (age, gender, GI symptoms at presentation, ICU admission). P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. All statistical analyses were performed using the stats package in R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (
17
).

Results

Patient Characteristics and Imaging Utilization:

A total of 412 adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were admitted at our institution during the study period, of which 136 (33%) were admitted to the ICU. Patients included 241 males (58%) and 171 females (42%), with an average age of 57 years (range 18 - >90 years; SD 18 years). Patients admitted to the ICU were, on average, older than other inpatients (59 vs 56 years, p=0.04). The proportion of patients who initially presented with at least one GI symptom was 34% (n=142/412), with no difference in proportion between those admitted to the ICU and other inpatients (29 vs 37%, p=0.08). Patients were followed for an average of 16.8 days (range 11-25 days) after admission.

For all patients, 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n=137; US, n=44; CT, n=42; MRI, n=1) on 134 of 412 patients (33%). In total, 72 patients (17%) had at least one cross sectional abdominal imaging study. Of patients with cross-sectional imaging, 92% (n=66/72) were admitted for a diagnosis of COVID-19, rather than for other reasons and then testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Abdominal imaging studies were associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per year increase, p=0.001) and ICU admission (OR 17.3, p<0.001). Abdominal imaging tended to be more likely in patients with GI symptoms at presentation, though this was not statistically significant (OR 1.61, p=0.09).

The most common indications for CT were abdominal pain (n=14/42, 33%) and sepsis (n=12/42, 29%). Of the ultrasounds performed (n=44), right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) was most common (n=37/44, 84%). The majority of RUQ US were performed on ICU patients (n=32/37, 86%). The most common indication for RUQ US was abnormal liver laboratory findings (n=31/37, 84%).

CT Findings:

Most CT scans were performed with IV contrast (n=35/42, 83%). Bowel wall abnormalities were found on 31% (n=13/42) of abdominal CT scans, and were associated with ICU admission (OR 15.5, p=0.01). The presence of bowel wall abnormalities was not associated with age (OR 1.06 per year of increase, p=0.10), gender (female OR 0.59, p=0.54), or GI symptoms at presentation (OR 2.02, p=0.40). Bowel wall thickening was identified on 29% (n=12/42) of CT scans, and included colon/rectal thickening (n=7) and small bowel thickening (n=5) (
Figure 1
). Small bowel thickening was exclusively seen in ICU patients in our study sample (ICU, n=5; non-ICU, n=0). Pneumatosis or portal venous gas (
Figures 2
-
5
) was identified on 20% of CT scans performed on ICU patients (n=4/20), constituting 2.9% of all ICU patients (n=4/136). A vascular cause was not identified on any of these CT scans. One of these patients (
Figure 5
) had pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI). In 3 of 4 patients with pneumatosis or portal venous gas, the finding was first identified on radiograph (n=2) or ultrasound (n=1) prior to CT being performed. One of the four patients had perforated small bowel, as evidenced by frank bowel wall discontinuity (
Figure 2A
).

These findings were confirmed at laparotomy (B), with the additional observation of atypical yellow discoloration of bowel.

These findings were confirmed at laparotomy (B), with the additional observation of atypical yellow discoloration of bowel.

In one patient who underwent abdominal CT for gastrointestinal symptoms, who was not being considered for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time, lung base findings led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Other CT findings included fluid-filled colon on 43% of scans (n=18/42), suggestive of diarrhea. ICU patients were more likely to have this finding than other inpatients (65 vs 23%, p=0.04). Two patients (4.8% of CT scans), both in the ICU, demonstrated evidence of at least one acute infarct in a solid organ (renal, splenic, or hepatic). CT findings are compiled in
Table 2
.

Ultrasound Findings

Gallbladder sludge and distention were seen in 54% (n=20/37) of RUQ ultrasounds, suggestive of cholestasis (
Figure 6
). Findings of cholestasis were not associated with age (OR 1.03 per year increase, p=0.32), gender (female OR 0.44, p=0.36), ICU admission (OR 5.83, p=0.17), or GI symptoms at presentation (OR 1.97, p=0.43). Four patients with findings of cholestasis, all ICU patients, went on to have cholecystostomy tubes placed by interventional radiology that revealed negative bacterial culture. Sonographic evidence of fatty liver was noted in 27% of studies (n=10/37). One ICU patient was incidentally found to have portal venous gas on ultrasound (
Figure 4A
), which was subsequently confirmed on CT. Ultrasound findings are outlined in
Table 2
.

Surgical and Pathologic Correlation

All patients with pneumatosis or portal venous gas at CT (n=4), suggestive of ischemia, underwent exploratory laparotomy. Two were found to have frankly necrotic bowel at surgery (those in
Figures 2
-
3
). In both patients, a yellow discoloration of small bowel loops was specifically noted by the surgeon at laparotomy (
Figure 2B
), in contrast to the usual purple or black color of necrotic bowel. One had bowel resection, with pathology (
Figure 3C
) demonstrating ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis ranging from mucosal to full thickness. Subjacent to necrotic mucosa, submucosal arterioles contained fibrin thrombi and others showed damage with perivascular neutrophils.

The other two patients did not have frank bowel necrosis at laparotomy. In one, with ileal pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis at CT (
Figure 5A
,
5B
), laparotomy demonstrated fibrotic ileum with pneumatosis but no obvious infarction. Pathology (
Figure 5C
,
5D
) revealed diffuse ischemic injury with multifocal necrosis, marked submucosal edema with empty spaces consistent with pneumatosis (
Figure 5C
), and occasional fibrin thrombi in submucosal arterioles beneath necrotic mucosa (
Figure 5D
). In the last patient, who had mesenteric gas adjacent to the transverse colon (
Figure 4B
), patches of yellow discoloration on the antimesenteric aspect of the transverse colon were seen at surgery. Second look laparotomy in this patient demonstrated no infarcted bowel but noted yellow discoloration of the stomach. No bowel was resected in this patient.

Discussion

Abdominal manifestations, including gastrointestinal symptoms and liver enzyme elevation, have been reported frequently in COVID-19 (
1
,
3
). But, to our knowledge, corresponding abdominal imaging findings have not been published. In our study, 34% of inpatients had gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation, similar to recent reports (
4
,
5
). Abdominal imaging was performed in 33% of inpatients with COVID-19, and 17% of patients had cross-sectional imaging. CT was most commonly performed for abdominal pain or sepsis, and ultrasound was most frequently performed for elevated liver enzymes.

Bowel wall findings were common on CT, and associated with ICU admission (OR 15.5, p=0.01). Findings included bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, and portal venous gas. Pneumatosis and portal venous gas are often seen in patients with mesenteric ischemia, which is common in critically ill patients (
18
). But numerous other etiologies including viral enteritis and positive pressure ventilation exist (
19
,
20
). Of the four patients in our series with pneumatosis or portal venous gas, three had either frank bowel infarction at laparotomy (n=2) or ischemic mucosal necrosis on pathology (n=2). At laparotomy, a yellow appearance of bowel was noted in three patients. Bowel infarction with gangrenous change can appear tan-yellow, which likely explains this appearance in the two patients with infarcted bowel at surgery (
21
). However, one patient in our study with gas in the transverse mesocolon at CT (
Figure 4B
) had corresponding patchy yellow discoloration of the antimesenteric transverse colon of unknown etiology.

Possible explanations for the spectrum of bowel findings in patients with COVID-19 include direct viral infection, small vessel thrombosis, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. ACE2 surface expression is most abundant in lung alveolar epithelium, enterocytes of small intestine, and vascular endothelium, suggesting that small bowel and vasculature may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (
8
,
9
). Findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 having a direct inflammatory effect on vascular endothelium have been reported (
22
). Further, systemic coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (
23
). This observation has been supported by descriptions of complement-mediated microvascular injury and vascular imaging abnormalities (
24
,
25
). Pathology in patients with bowel resection in our series demonstrated ischemic mucosal necrosis and fibrin thrombi in submucosal arterioles of necrotic segments. Although it can be difficult to determine whether fibrin thrombi are the cause of ischemia in necrotic bowel, given the coagulopathy these patients experience, they are likely pathogenic (
26
). The biologic basis that explains the spectrum of bowel imaging findings in COVID-19 patients warrants further investigation.

In three of the four patients with pneumatosis or portal venous gas, the finding was initially identified on radiograph or ultrasound. This emphasizes the importance of radiologists being alert to these findings on all imaging modalities. Although ultrasound is sensitive for portal venous gas, radiography is insensitive for both pneumatosis and portal venous gas (
27
). Two cases with pneumatosis or portal venous gas in our series were initially detected on radiograph, the most commonly performed modality in our study, raising the possibility that these manifestations are present more frequently than we have recognized. On CT, fluid-filled colon was seen frequently, often considered to indicate diarrhea. Diarrhea is common in ICU patients (
28
), and fluid-filled colon was more common in ICU patients in our study. However, GI symptoms such as diarrhea are common at presentation in COVID-19 and can be overlooked (
3
). Although liquid stool often escapes comment on CT, this finding might provide the first indication of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

Although elevated liver enzymes have been reported frequently in patients with COVID-19 (
1
,
6
), the etiology is uncertain. Findings of cholestasis were seen on 54% of RUQ US in our series. Of the 20 patients with findings of cholestasis, 4 had cholecystostomy tubes placed that had negative bacterial culture. Imaging and laboratory findings of cholestasis are common in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU (
29
,
30
). Although ICU patients with COVID-19 are often hypercoagulable (
31
), we did not identify any patients with portal vein thrombosis.

The main limitation of this study was that of a single center retrospective study, which limits its generalizability and introduces selection bias. Pathologic correlation and clinical follow-up was not available for many patients with imaging abnormalities.

In conclusion, abdominal imaging was often performed for inpatients with COVID-19. RUQ US most frequently demonstrated cholestasis, which is common in critically ill patients. Bowel wall abnormalities identified by CT, mostly in ICU patients, included pneumatosis and portal venous gas suggestive of ischemia. Laparotomy and pathology findings confirmed small bowel ischemia in some patients, which may have been due to small vessel thrombosis. The cause of bowel abnormalities in patients who did not go to surgery remains uncertain. Further studies are required to clarify the cause of bowel findings in patients with COVID-19, in particular the role of small vessel thrombi and coagulopathy in bowel ischemia, and to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in bowel or vascular injury."

Objectives.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made a major impact on hospital services globally, including the care of persons with diabetes and endocrine disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies (AFES) member countries; to describe challenges, changes and opportunities in caring for patients with endocrine diseases, as well as in fellowship training programs, and endocrine-related
research in the AFES countries.

Methodology.
The

eeds in
E
ndocrinology (
AFES A.S.-O.N.E.
) was an open-ended questionnaire that was sent to the presidents and representatives of the AFES member countries by email. Responses from Societies were collated and synthesized to obtain perspectives on the emergent issues in endocrinology in the Southeast Asian region during this pandemic.

Results.
The burden of COVID-19 cases varied widely across the AFES member countries, with the least number of cases in Vietnam and Myanmar, and the greatest number of cases in either the most populous countries (Indonesia and the Philippines), or a country with the highest capability for testing (Singapore). The case fatality rate was also the highest for Indonesia and the Philippines at around 6%, and lowest for Vietnam at no fatalities. The percentage with diabetes among patients with COVID-19 ranged from 5% in Indonesia to 20% in Singapore, approximating the reported percentages in China and the United States. The major challenges in managing patients with endocrine diseases involved inaccessibility of health care providers, clinics and hospitals due to the implementation of lockdowns, community quarantines or movement control among the member countries. This led to disruptions in the continuity of care, testing and monitoring, and for some, provision of both preventive care and active management including surgery for thyroid cancer or pituitary and adrenal tumors, and radioactive iodine therapy. Major disruptions in the endocrine fellowship training programs were also noted across the region, so that some countries have had to freeze hiring of new trainees or to revise both program requirements and approaches to training due to the closure of outpatient endocrine clinics. The same observations are seen for endocrine-related researches, as most research papers have focused on the pandemic. Finally, the report ends by describing innovative approaches to fill in the gap in training and in improving patient access to endocrine services by Telemedicine.

Conclusion.
The burden of COVID-19 cases and its case fatality rate varies across the AFES member countries but its impact is almost uniform: it has disrupted the provision of care for patients with endocrine diseases, and has also disrupted endocrine fellowship training and endocrine-related research across the region. Telemedicine and innovations in training have been operationalized across the AFES countries in an attempt to cope with the disruptions from
COVID-19, but its over-all impact on the practice of endocrinology across the region will only become apparent once we conquer this pandemic.

A Report of Thromboelastography Findings and other Parameters of Hemostasis …","Emmental Hospital, situated in the rural town of Burgdorf in Switzerland, has treated a low volume of inpatients with COVID-19. Of the 13 admissions prior to 30th April 2020, 4 required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Here we report on 3 consecutive inpatients with severe COVID-19, following the unexpected death of our first patient with severe COVID-19 from pulmonary embolism.

], there was a slight decrease of VWF antigen, VWF activity and FVIII:C (
Table 1
, patient 1) after one week of intravenous therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin with an anti-FXa-activity target range of 0.6-0.8 U/mL. At this time, we measured a normal ADAMTS13 activity. This patient, 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms, has now been discharged for further rehabilitation while under continued therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban 2 x 5 mg daily.

We observed a second patient with severe COVID-19 and typical radiological findings of bilateral pneumonia, requiring intensive care with intubation and positive pressure ventilation. She was a 60-year-old female with no previous medical history and no regular medication. Eleven days after the onset of a dry cough, with loss of appetite and a worsening general condition, but with no fever or dyspnoea, she suffered a syncope and was hospitalised. Her haemostatic laboratory values at admission (day 11) and 7 days later are summarised in
Table 1
(patient 2). VWF activity, VWF antigen and FVIII:C were markedly elevated, and ADAMTS13 activity was normal. In accordance with our local guidelines for anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19, stratified by D-dimer levels, the patient received a double-prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin, i.e. 2 x 5000 IU of dalteparin s.c. per day upon admission. Seven days later, due to increasing D-dimers, anticoagulation was intensified to a therapeutic dose of dalteparin, i.e. 10'000 IU in the morning and 7'500 IU at night. The patient has since recovered and after a 15-day hospitalisation was discharged home with therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban, 5 mg twice daily. Of note, anti-phospholipid antibodies were normal or near normal (
Table 1
).

The third patient was a 66-year-old obese female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and her daily medication was acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, candesartan 32 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, metformin 2000 mg, vildagliptin 100 mg, fenofibrate 200 mg and pravastatin 40 mg. She was admitted for inpatient monitoring 4 days after the onset of fever of 39.8 degC, a productive cough with white sputum, no dyspnoea but loss of appetite, adynamia and diarrhoea 2 days before admission. Radiological findings showed typical COVID-19 associated diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Initially her D-dimer levels were 0.53 mg/L and prophylactic dalteparin 5000 IU s.c. once daily was given. While clinically stable and with C-reactive protein decreasing from 78 to 16 mg/L, monitoring of the haemostatic laboratory values 14 days after the onset of symptoms showed elevated D-dimers and massively elevated levels of VWF and FVIII:C (
Table 1
, patient 3). ADAMTS13 activity was normal, and no antiphospholipid antibodies were detected. A therapeutic dose of dalteparin was started, and three days later the patient could be discharged with apixaban 5 mg twice daily.

In all three patients, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was markedly increased and remained substantially elevated (
Table 1
). Serum protein electrophoresis reflected acute inflammation and immunofixation was inconclusive with possible traces of oligoclonal bands. Quantitative measurements of IgM, IgG and IgA were normal.

Prior to starting therapeutic dose anticoagulation in these 3 patients, we had observed a patient with severe COVID-19 who seemed to have almost recovered and then died suddenly from clinically obvious pulmonary embolism (with acute right heart failure in the clinical examination as well as on emergency echocardiography) while on prophylactic anticoagulation. In addition, reports from China showed a coagulopathy in 50% of the non-survivors and the prognostic value of D-dimers [

]. Based on these observations, we adapted our local guidelines with increased dose heparin according to D-dimer levels. After introducing therapeutic-dose anticoagulation into our therapeutic concept, all patients recovered, with rapid clinical improvement but slow and protracted improvement of D-dimers, persistently high VWF and factor VIII:C levels, and, interestingly, also of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No haemorrhagic complication occurred. Since then, the findings of highly elevated VWF and factor VIII have also been reported in a small Italian and a large French cohort [

In our patients, normal ADAMTS13 activity together with normal platelet counts (
Table 1
) clearly excludes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Notably, there were no schistocytes in the blood smears, which does not support a diagnosis of classic thrombotic microangiopathy. Whereas in severe sepsis or septic shock not due to SARS-CoV-2, some 30% of patients had mildly reduced ADAMTS13 activity of 27-50% [

], our 3 COVID-19 patients had normal ADAMTS13 activity suggesting that ADAMTS13 does not play a major pathogenic role in the COVID-19 coagulopathy. Moreover, the normal platelet counts and high fibrinogen levels in all our patients (lowest value 3.48 g/L) clearly rule out classical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in our patients, in keeping with the low prevalence of DIC (0-2%) in other larger cohorts [

]. Considering these findings, the COVID-19 coagulopathy may be a distinct entity of highly prothrombotic alterations and - in light of the persistently and excessively elevated levels of VWF and FVIII - most probably an endothelial disease."

Racial and ethnic minority groups warrant special consideration when screening and treating for COVID-19. In the United States, which is perhaps the most ethnically diverse country in the world, emerging statistics from epicenter cities are showing significant disparities in rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in Latino/Hispanic and African American populations.

These disparities have been demonstrated in New York City, which showed the highest mortality rates among Latino/Hispanic Americans, followed by African Americans, disproportionate to their representative populations. Although they make up 29% of the population, 34% of COVID-19 deaths in New York City were among Latino/Hispanic Americans, and although they make up 22% of the population, 28% of deaths were among African American patients.
1
Similarly in Chicago, 50% of the reported infections were in African Americans and up to 70% of COVID-19-associated deaths were among African Americans, although they represent only 29% of the Chicago population. In Chicago, Latino/Hispanic Americans did not see the same elevated mortality rates, representing just 15% of deaths in a city where they make up 28% of the population.
2

The disparities persist in states as well. In Michigan, 40% of COVID-19 mortality was among African Americans, despite the fact that they make up only 14% of the population. In Louisiana, 70% of deaths have been among African Americans, despite them making up 30% of the population. These patterns have also been reported in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Georgia.

There is little published information about the effects of COVID-19 on these populations, as other epicenter cities in China and Italy have more ethnically homogenous populations compared to the United States. Additionally, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, there were approximately 8,000 cases worldwide, and the majority were in China, leaving minimal information about how these groups were affected during a similar outbreak.

Early reports published in China show that the greatest risk factors for COVID-19 infection are diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD). Analysis of data collected during the SARS outbreak in 2003 demonstrated that diabetes and heart disease were independently associated with mortality.
3
In China this year, data analyzing mortality rates and comorbidities from 1,590 patients with COVID-19 showed the most prevalent risk factors associated with mortality were hypertension, diabetes, COPD, and malignancy.
4

African American and Latino/Hispanic Americans have higher rates of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is 21% in African Americans, compared to 11% in non-Hispanic whites.
5
One study published in
JAMA
in 2017 showed that African Americans have nearly double the rate of development of type 2 diabetes during middle adulthood compared to non-Hispanic white Americans. The same study also demonstrated that biological factors, including fasting blood glucose levels and body mass index, were the most strongly associated with the disparity when adjustments for behavioral, socioeconomic, and psychological factors were made.
6
Forty-two percent of African American men and 44% of African American women have diagnosed or undiagnosed hypertension, which is 10% higher than other racial groups in the US and one of the highest rates worldwide.
7
Rates of CAD are not significantly statistically different between African Americans (6.5%) and non-Hispanic white Americans (5.8%), as reported by the CDC. When analyzed further, rates of CAD were slightly higher in non-Hispanic white men at 7.7%, compared to African American men at 7.3%. However, African American women had a higher rate of CAD at 5.9%, compared to non-Hispanic white women at 4%.
8

Latino/Hispanic Americans are now one of the largest ethnic minorities in the US. Overall, less data exist analyzing Hispanic American risk factors, as they represent both a younger population as well as a population more recently immigrated to the US. However, trends in younger populations indicate that Latino/Hispanic Americans are at higher risk for cardiovascular complications. Latino/Hispanic Americans have a 17% rate of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, compared to 10.7% of non-Hispanic white men and 19.1% of non-Hispanic African Americans. Latino/Hispanic women have a 16.4% rate of diabetes, while non-Hispanic white Americans have a rate of 8.4%. African American women have a rate of 18.7%. Furthermore, the rate of pre-diabetes among Latino/Hispanic Americans is among the highest of any ethnic group at 44%.
9
This may be representative of Latino/Hispanics generally being young and may indicate that future cardiovascular risk will increase as the population ages.

Socioeconomic status, independent of race, may be a significant risk factor for primary COVID-19 infection. Middle-class and upper middle-class Americans are more easily able to telecommute, and they receive a salary that is more resistant to economic downturns. By contrast, working class Americans rely on their ability to work a consistent number of hours to maintain their pay. As a result, working class individuals are far more likely to continue to work, use public transportation, and risk health-related complications for economic stability.

Population statistics from Chicago demonstrate this phenomenon, where the rate of infection is highest in African Americans, correlating with poverty levels in that city. African Americans make up 36% of those living in poverty in Chicago, yet they represent 50% of COVID-19 infections. Latino/Hispanic Americans in Chicago have poverty rates of 23%, which is lower than both African American and non-Hispanic white Chicagoans.
2,10
In New York City, Latino/Hispanic Americans have the highest mortality rate from COVID-19 as well as the second highest poverty levels at 22%. Asian Americans have the highest percentage of poverty in New York City at 23%. African Americans have the third highest with 20%, with non-Hispanic white New Yorkers at 12%.

Asian Americans have been the subject of intense scrutiny over the course of the pandemic, with some experiencing racism due to the origin of the virus in Asia. However, as a minority population in the US, they have had the lowest infection rates of any racial or ethnic group. In New York City, Asian Americans are reported to have the highest poverty levels, making up 23% of those living in poverty. However, their rate of death from COVID-19 in New York City has been significantly lower, representing just 7% of the mortality while making up 14% of the population.
1
In Chicago, Asian Americans have the lowest poverty levels of any race, with 4% of Asian Americans living below the poverty level, and they had similarly low rates of COVID-19 infection at 3.6%.

Strategies for prevention, screening, and mitigation of disparity

Emergency physicians should be aware of these epidemiological trends in the US, so they can better screen, test, and treat patients. There should be heightened suspicion for COVID-19 prevalence and disproportionate morbidity and mortality among underserved minority populations. Aggressive education, adequate access to screening and testing, and proactive management strategies should be prioritized. All patients with mild symptoms who are discharged from the emergency department or hospital should be questioned about the people with whom they live and any risk factors they may have. It is critical to ensure that there is adequate understanding of recommendations among patients who speak a language other than English. A translator should be used to communicate with such patients, and they should be provided with educational material in their own language. Patients who are to be admitted to the hospital should have standard management of COVID-19 as outlined by published official recommendations.

It is important to be aware that some underserved racial and ethnic groups may have underlying comorbidities that may not be diagnosed or treated due to limited access to primary care. Hispanics and African Americans who are over age 40 years should be treated as higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Additionally, COVID-19 may create a hypercoagulable state, making individuals prone to true myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or DVT.
11
These populations would benefit from baseline troponin and ECG screening in the emergency department, in addition to other diagnostic management, as troponin has been shown to correlate with mortality. Those with more severe illness with risk factors would also benefit from an echocardiogram early in admission to screen for the development of myocarditis.
3

Robust tracking of granular demographic data relative to COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality is necessary to better understand the factors associated with the disproportionate impact of this disease on underserved racial and ethnic minority groups. This data should be collected and accessible in order to foster research and analysis of this phenomenon."

The novel coronavirus (""SARS-CoV-2"") outbreak has created a sense of panic globally and has the medical community rapidly searching for answers. An estimated 100,000 individuals have already been infected with nearly 3300 deaths attributed to the disease (termed COVID-19) [
1
]. The search for effective treatment is underway with multiple investigations ongoing across the world. Chinese authorities have reported success treating infected patients with donated plasma from survivors of the illness, the proposed benefit being protective antibodies formed by the survivors [
2
]. Plasma transfusion and blood purification are not novel therapies, and we propose therapeutic plasma exchange as a possible treatment for fulminant COVID-19.

With COVID-19, the degree of illness varies, ranging from asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal. The World Health Organization estimates that serious illness may occur in as many as 13.8% of cases and 6.1% are critical [
3
]. When fulminant, patients may develop sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and/or multiple organ failure which are not unique to coronavirus. While treatment of the virus itself is certainly desired, treatment of the systemic response is likely to be the more important aspect of care and should be aggressively sought. This host response to infection has been well described and involves a complex interaction of cytokine storm, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and pathologic coagulation [

,

,

,

,

]. The pathway is common to multiple inciting events and has been the target of treatment for years, with therapeutic plasma exchange uniquely offering benefit on multiple levels by removing inflammatory cytokines, stabilizing endothelial membranes, and resetting the hypercoagulable state [
4

,
9
]. An in-depth review is beyond the scope of this editorial, but the reader is encouraged to review the referenced articles. Figure

briefly illustrates the pathway.

Fig. 1

Physiologic pathway of sepsis which serve as potential targets of therapeutic plasma exchange

Busund and colleagues showed a tendency toward improved mortality with adjunct TPE in adult patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure in the sole, adult-only randomized controlled trial on this subject [
10
] while a meta-analysis by Rimmer showed mortality benefit in adult patients as well [
11
]. Drawing from this data, Patel and colleagues utilized TPE during the 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in three pediatric patients presenting in a similar fashion to those seen with fulminant COVID-19 today [
12
]. All three patients developed ARDS with hemodynamic compromise that continued to deteriorate despite standard care and rescue therapy for ARDS including inhaled nitric oxide (3/3) and veno-venous ECMO (1/3). Predicted mortality was high, but all three had full recovery from their illness after receiving rescue TPE.

Others have reported successful outcomes, feasibility, and safety of TPE for sepsis, but none have investigated specifically in pneumonia/ARDS. Our group has recently submitted the results of our single-center experience with TPE in sepsis with multiple organ failure with the manuscript currently under consideration for publication with preprint available online (DOI:
https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-16022/v1
) [
13
]. In our trial, charts were retrospectively reviewed and patients receiving adjunct TPE were propensity matched to patients with similar illness who received standard of care alone. Full details are available online, but it should be noted that all patients required >= 2 vasopressors and all patients receiving TPE required mechanical ventilator support. Nearly half of the patients in both groups (39/80) presented with pneumonia as the primary source of infection, and a subgroup analysis showed the greatest mortality benefit with TPE in these patients (47.8% mortality vs. 81.3% mortality,
p
= 0.05). While a single-center, retrospective trial is obviously limited, the results are very encouraging and support the need for further investigation, particularly in today's environment with increasing incidence of COVID-19. Our practice has changed based on our experience, and we now often utilize TPE earlier in the clinical course of septic shock with MODS and ARDS rather than as ""rescue therapy."" Anecdotally, the results have been remarkable but have not been reviewed or statistically analyzed.

The novel coronavirus has generated worldwide attention due to the potential impact on global health. The uncertainties of the disease are frightening, but it is likely that the host response to coronavirus is the same as that seen in other infections. Presently, treatment for sepsis and ARDS centers on early antimicrobials, source control, and ""supportive care."" This outbreak should serve as impetus to investigate therapies targeting the pathways that lead to the morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes. Therapeutic plasma exchange shows promise, and we propose that randomized trials be designed to investigate further.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2018
) recommends thromboprophylaxis, after risk assessment, for acutely ill medical patients for at least 7 days. The primary agent of choice is low molecular weight heparin with fondaparinux as a second choice. A maximum duration of anticoagulation was not delineated in this group of patients. In orthopaedic patients, consideration of chemical thromboprophylaxis is recommended when there is lower limb immobilisation and resulting reduction in mobility, where risk of thrombosis outweighs the risk of bleeding, for up to 42 days (6 weeks). In the authors' experience, the time to recovery in patients discharged from the hospital setting after treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is often significantly longer than initially might have been expected. Additionally, these patients have been on bed rest and are at risk of dehydration for considerable periods during their hospital stay, and social distancing while both recuperating and rehabilitating will dramatically reduce their mobility.

Extrapolating from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance and in line with both the JACC guidance (
Bikdeli et al, 2020
), and the The
COVID-19 Sub-Committee of the American Venous Forum's (2020)
white paper, the authors' strategy is to initiate chemical thromboprophylaxis in risk-assessed patients for 2-6 weeks post discharge. In the authors' hospital, the longer duration of thromboprophylaxis (6 weeks) is favoured to prevent venous thromboembolism in view of experience with patients requiring prolonged time to reasonable recovery and also re-attendances with venous thromboembolism. As the pandemic has impacted on the availability of district nurses to attend to patients who cannot self-treat or receive low molecular weight heparin injections from family members, and extrapolating from the results of the trials of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery (
Erikkson et al, 2009
;
Lassen et al, 2010a
,
2010b
), the recommendation is that patients are treated with a direct oral anticoagulant; the authors recognise that this is outside licencing. The primary agents of choice are either apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, together with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce the risk of clinically relevant non-major gastrointestinal bleeding (
Ray et al, 2018
). If a direct oral anticoagulant is unsuitable, or if injection of low molecular weight heparin is preferred, then thromboprophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin is advised. Where the risk of bleeding is significant, mechanical thromboprophylaxis with anti-embolism stockings is recommended.

After implementation of this guideline, the authors intend to review the incidence of venous thrombosis in the post-discharge period in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Key points

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a hypercoagulable state.

Recovery after discharge from hospital to baseline is prolonged.

Extended thromboprophylaxis (2-6 weeks) should be considered to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism caused by the hypercoagulable state and reduced mobility during the prolonged convalescent period, after a risk assessment is undertaken.

Chemical thromboprophylaxis with a direct oral anticoagulant (such as rivaroxaban or apixaban), although outside of licensing, is easier to administer than injecting low molecular weight heparin in the community setting.

If chemical thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated, mechanical thromboprophylaxis with anti-embolism stockings should be considered."

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly disrupts the respiratory system, there is accumulating experience that the disease, particularly in its more severe manifestations, also affects the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19."

Abstract

While much is known about the respiratory complications of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a wider spectrum of neurologic manifestations are beginning to be observed.
1
We report 2 patients who presented to our hospital in New York, an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract

COVID-19 is associated with significant hypercoagulability. However, despite prophylactic anticoagulation, critically-ill patients with this condition develop thromboses. This forum discusses the lungs as the epicentre for the haemostatic issues, put forwards a proposal for staging COVID-19 coagulopathy based on available diagnostic markers, and suggest considering current and future treatment options based on these different stages.

COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) is the main driver of mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2. It is a specific disease with features distinct from typical acute respiratory distress syndrome. Understanding the pathophysiology of this 'syndrome' is critical in preventing intensive care admissions and mortality. Early CARDS lung physiology appears to be consistent with that of ventilation perfusion mismatch from regional perfusion defects, and hemodynamics mimic that of acute pulmonary embolism. Coagulopathy appears to be due to consumption from subclinical microvascular thrombosis. Radiology findings are consistent with progressive pulmonary infarcts. A primary vascular insult from viral endothelitis resulting in diffuse microvascular pulmonary thrombosis explains early CARDS. Natural and iatrogenic sequelae explain the observed spectrum. Evidence for an initial lung parenchymal insult from viral cytopathic damage or dysregulated immune response is lacking. Symptoms and hypoxemia are poor indicators of the extent of lung microvascular obstruction as lung perfusion reserve maintains oxygenation at rest until more than 50% of perfusion is occluded, in the absence of ventilation and diffusion abnormalities. High mortality in CARDS may be due to mistakenly equating severity of symptoms with severity of physiological compromise, in patients with extensive microvascular thrombosis. Understanding this pathophysiology indicates that risk stratification and vital interventions should commence much before hypoxemia and symptoms occur.

Also for our neurocritical …","These days, there are multiple papers emerging daily about COVID-19 management, protocols, guidelines, etc. Many research protocols are in play, but c
urrent management of COVID-19 still remains supportive
.

We were intially told the virus would only seriously affect older people; however, in Spain, we are seeing young people -- many in their 30s -- rapidly deteriorating, requiring rapid intubation, mechanical ventilation and prone positioning to try to stabilize and support them. Why is this happening?

In our opinion, it's important to keep two points in mind:
1. In some ways, the
behavior of COVID-19 has similar
characteristics to the HIV virus.

HIV is also an
enveloped virus
. COVID-19
has four small pieces of RNA sequences in its genetic code that are not found in other similar coronaviruses like SARS
(
severe acute respiratory syndrome
). T
hese strands, however, do bear some resemblance to bits of sequence also found in HIV.

Similar to HIV-1 Gp41, the S2 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein contains HR1 and HR2 sequences, which tend to form a coiled-coil structure. The amino acid sequences of peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein are similar to those from the HIV-1 Gp41 HR1 and HR2 regions
. T
he similarity suggests that these two transmembrane envelope glycoproteins share a common mechanism mediating fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes
[1]. Indeed,
lopinavir and ritonavir,
two drugs to treat HIV in combination, are used in the treatment of COVID-19 by some centers.

A key point is lymphopenia is a hallmark of the disease and seems to predict
severity of COVID-19
[2,3].
Autopsy series
have
show
n us the
severe damage to
the
lungs and the immune system. Prevention of fibrosis of in the lungs during the early stage of the disease is a fundamental goal in supportive therapy. The influence of COVID-19 on the human body can be summarized as a combination of SARS and AIDS, as it damages both the lungs and immune systems.

2. R
espiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality in patients infected by COVID-19
.

People are dying from a massive lung inflammatory response, not from the virus. A massive activation of the cytokine cascade (SIRS) seems to be the main cause of death.

I
dentification and early treatment of this cytokine cascade
would be key
to the reduction of the deaths we are seing around the world.
We are seeing that this disease has characteristics of these two known syndromes:

Antiphospholipid syndrome
,
a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of thombus.
D-dimer is elevated in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and other coagulation indicators are abnormal. In this syndrome, thrombocytopenia is also seen in COVID-19 infection. Also, we are seeing microthrombus in patients with COVID-19.

So, we have two controversial questions:

1. Should we give high doses of steroids in these patients to stop the cytokines storm?
2. Should we give anticoagulant doses in patients with high D-Dimer?

Recently, the
Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with COVID-19
[4] were released. The guidelines suggest the use of
low-dose corticosteroid therapy
for
""shock-reversal
""
(weak recommendation, low
-
quality evidence).
The WHO, however, does not recommend either
routine use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia outside of clinical trials
[5].

So, if we want to stop the cytokines storm, is there another option for treatment if steroids are not agreed upon by major organizations? The answer is yes.
We recommend large doses of vitamin C
[6].

Vitamin C, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenously
.
The potential effect of vitamin C in reducing inflammation in the lungs
[7]
could play a key role in lung injury caused by
COVID-19.

Vitamin C has been shown to increase resistance to infection caused by coronavirus, also modifying the susceptibility to the infection
[8]. V
itamin C can also help eliminate alveolar fluid accumulation, a major part of ARDS, by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage.

Some clinical trials have already been registered.
Peng Zhiyong, Director of Intensive Care at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University,
is one of the investigators [
clinical tria
l i
dentifier: NCT04264533] of a Chinese study
. We have developed a protocol for vitamin C administration (see Table 1 below). The potential side effects are minimal, and the benefits could be major.

In regards to D-Dimer elevation, we strongly recommend a l
ow-molecular-weight heparin in the anticoagulative dose
due to the risk of microemboli formation, and, therefore, risk of stroke, myocardial infarct, pulmonary embolism and spleenic infarct. We have also seen some patients die from myocardial infarct and stroke who present positive for COVID-19. Some autopsy series have shown us high incidence of pulmonary embolism and micro-thrombus in pulmonary circulation. We have been also seeing an excessive CRRT circuit clotting or dialysis catheter malfunction in COVID 19 patients, most likely from their hypercoagulable/SIRS state. Also for our neurocritical care colleagues, we have observed patients who have presented with marked clinical signs of encephalopathy with agitation in our Spanish ICUs. Ongoing evaluation of this syndrome is in play.

Since December 2019, the global pandemic caused by the highly infectious novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading. As of April 2020, the outbreak has spread to over 210 countries, with over 2,400,000 confirmed cases and over 170,000 deaths
[1]
. COVID-19 causes a severe pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Similar coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in the past causing severe pneumonia like COVID-19, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, over time, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to cause extra-pulmonary signs and symptoms including hepatitis, acute renal failure, encephalitis, myositis, and gastroenteritis. Similarly, sporadic reports of COVID-19 related extrapulmonary manifestations emerge. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive summary of the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19, making it difficult for clinicians to quickly educate themselves about this highly contagious and deadly pathogen. What's more, is that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the closest humanity has come to combating something similar to COVID-19, however, there exists no comparison between the manifestations of any of these novel coronaviruses. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the manifestations of the novel coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19, with a particular focus on the latter, and highlight their differences and similarities."

The risk of COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) is largely unknown and there have been very few reported cases in the literature. We report a case series of five PLWH with COVID-19. We identified all patients with a diagnosis of HIV who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Chicago Medicine between March 1, 2020, and April 7, 2020. We retrospectively collected data regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory test results, radiology results, and outcomes associated with COVID-19. All five PLWH with COVID-19 were African American; 80% (4/5) were cisgender females. The mean age of patients was 48 years old (range 38-53). The majority of patients presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Three patients had diarrhea. One patient presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms. All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 count >200 cells/mm
3
and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. All five patients were hospitalized, two required supplemental oxygen, and none required mechanical ventilation. Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7). All patients recovered. More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.

Introduction

The risk of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, among people living with HIV (PLWH) is unknown. Some scientists have speculated that PLWH taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be at decreased risk for COVID-19 because HIV antiretroviral medications may have activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.
1
PLWH also may be at decreased risk for complications of COVID-19 because their defective cellular immunity may reduce the possibility of the cytokine dysregulation that is associated with severe cases of COVID-19.
2
,
3
Others have suggested that the opposite may be true: PLWH may be at increased risk for COVID-19 due to immunosuppression.
4
The literature from the SARS outbreak of 2003 caused by SARS-CoV-1 provides some evidence that HIV infection is associated with a milder course of SARS and that HIV antiretroviral medications may reduce mortality and adverse outcomes from SARS.
5
,
6

In the United States, African Americans have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
5
In majority African American counties in the United States, the COVID-19 infection rates and death rates are three and six times higher, respectively, than those of majority white counties. This may be due to a higher burden of comorbidities, poorer social determinants of health, and socioeconomic factors that make it difficult for African Americans to socially distance.
6
African Americans are also disproportionately affected by HIV, but large studies in the United Kingdom and New York City during the early months of the pandemic have found that PLWH are underrepresented among severe COVID-19 cases.
7
,
8

There is very little published literature to date regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 among PLWH. Two case reports from China and a small case series from Spain have described a total of seven PLWH who developed COVID-19. All reported cases were male or transgender, few had medical comorbidities, and all recovered except for one patient who remained in the intensive care unit at the time of the report.
9-11
Data are lacking regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 among cisgender female PLWH as well as among PLWH with other comorbidities.

Methods

We identified all patients with a diagnosis of HIV who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 at University of Chicago Medicine between March 1, 2020, and April 7, 2020. This study was approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board. A waiver of consent was granted as only deidentified data were extracted from the medical record. We report the cases of five PLWH diagnosed with COVID-19, including four cisgender females (
Table 1
).

Results

Case 1

A 38-year-old African American cisgender male with HIV presented to the emergency department (ED) with 7 days of fever, dry cough, shortness of breath (SOB), headache, and myalgias. He also had 3 days of diarrhea. Medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2 with a hemoglobin A1C of 9.9%, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. He reported compliance with ART of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine.

He was treated with empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin for 5 days for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Hydroxychloroquine was started on hospital day (HD) 3, at a dosage of 400 mg po every 12 h for 2 doses followed by 200 mg po every 12 h to complete 5 days. He did not require supplemental oxygen throughout the hospital stay. He clinically recovered and was discharged on HD 5.

Case 2

A 50-year-old African American cisgender female with HIV presented to the ED with 1 week of cough productive of white sputum, daily fevers, and progressive SOB as well as 1 day of headache. She denied any sick contacts. She endorsed adherence to her antiretroviral regimen of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Her only significant comorbidity was obesity.

On presentation, she was afebrile with a temperature of 36.6degC, and had an oxygenation saturation of 88% on RA, which improved to 93% with 2 L nasal cannula (NC). She was admitted due to hypoxia. Nasopharyngeal sample for SARS CoV-2 PCR was positive and RVP was negative. HIV VL was undetectable and CD4 was 305 cells/mm
3
on the day of admission. Chest X-ray showed mild multi-focal patchy airspace consolidation in the left lower lobe.

On HD 2, her oxygenation status slightly worsened and she required 3-4 L oxygen by NC. She was treated with 5 days of azithromycin and 1 dose of ceftriaxone followed by 4 days of cefdinir for possible CAP. She did not receive any therapy for COVID-19. Her oxygenation improved and she was discharged on HD 4.

Case 3

A 51-year-old African American cisgender female with HIV presented to the ED with 1 week of cough productive of yellow sputum, myalgias, SOB, 4 days of fever, and 1 day of watery diarrhea. Her only medical history was a remote history of latent tuberculosis treated with isoniazid for 9 months. She reported good adherence to her ART regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, with most recent VL undetectable 7 months before admission, but she had missed 5 days of ART before admission.

On presentation, her oxygen saturation was 93% on RA, and she was given 2 L oxygen by NC. She was admitted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Her temperature was 36.4degC on admission, but increased to 39.3degC the second day of admission. Nasopharyngeal sample for SARS CoV-2 PCR was positive and RVP was negative. CD4 count on admission was 265 cells/mm
3
. Chest X-ray showed bilateral perihilar and basilar patchy airspace and interstitial opacities.

She was initiated on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric CAP treatment, with ceftriaxone transitioned to cefdinir on HD 2 to complete a 5 day course. She was treated with hydroxycholoroquine at a dosage of 400 mg po every 12 h for 2 doses followed by 200 mg po every 12 h to complete 5 days. She clinically improved and was discharged on HD 7.

Case 4

A 53-year-old African American cisgender female with HIV and a history of esophageal strictures status post stenting complicated by bronchoesophageal and tracheoesophageal fistulas presented with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, intermittent diarrhea, dehydration, and cough of productive sputum. She endorsed chills, but denied any fever. She denied any sick contacts. She reported missing several doses of her ART regimen of bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofivir alafenamide, ritonavir, and darunavir in the days before admission, due to nausea and vomiting.

On presentation she was febrile to 39degC and had oxygen saturation of 97% on RA. She was admitted after she was found to be dehydrated and hyponatremic with a sodium of 127 mmol/L (ref. range 134-149 mmol/L). The day of admission she had a HIV VL of 24.6 copies/mL and a CD4 count of 268 cells/mm
3
. Nasopharyngeal sample for SARS CoV-2 PCR was positive, and RVP and multiplex PCR gastrointestinal panel were both negative. Her chest X-ray was unremarkable.

She was treated with 5 days of cefdinir and azithromycin for empiric CAP treatment. She did not require supplemental oxygen throughout her hospital stay and was discharged on HD 3.

Case 5

A 47-year-old African American cisgender female with HIV presented to the ED with 1 day of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, intermittent chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and chills. She denied sick contacts. She reported she had missed the past 2 weeks of her ART regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, darunavir, ritonavir, and raltegravir. Her medical history was notable for heart failure with ejection fraction of 15% with implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and morbid obesity. Five months before admission, she had a cerebrovascular accident and acute pulmonary embolism for which she was prescribed anticoagulation with warfarin.

On presentation she was afebrile and tachycardic with an oxygen saturation of 100% on RA. In the ED, she experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with aberrancy after which she was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. High sensitivity troponin T was 30 ng/L (ref range <14 ng/L). International normalized ratio (INR) was subtherapeutic at 1.1. Her HIV VL was undetectable and CD4 count was 500 cells/mm
3
. On the day of admission, a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS CoV-2 PCR test was negative. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT showed wedge-shaped splenic infarction.

A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS CoV-2 PCR was repeated on HD 3 with a positive result. Her medical providers recommended she remain in the hospital until her INR normalized, but the patient elected to be discharged against medical advice on HD 3. She returned to clinic to monitor her INR 3 days after discharge, at which point she endorsed resolution of symptoms.

Discussion

We report the first case series of PLWH with COVID-19 from the United States, of whom all five were African American and four were cisgender females. All patients had CD4 count >200 cells/mm
3
, were taking ART, and were virally suppressed. Antiretrovirals commonly used to treat HIV may have activity against SARS CoV-2, and are actively being studied as treatment for COVID-19. Although studies from the 2003 SARS epidemic showed a decrease in mortality, intubation rates, and adverse outcomes of SARS with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir,
12
,
13
a recent clinical trial showed no benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir used alone for treatment of severe COVID-19.
14
Other clinical trials are ongoing, including a clinical trial of tenofovir/emtricitabine for pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 in health care workers,
15
and a clinical trial of darunavir/cobicistat for treatment of COVID-19.
16

Although all five patients required hospitalization, they also had a relatively mild clinical course with a median length of stay of only 3 days. Only two patients required supplemental oxygen therapy. One patient was admitted to the cardiac ICU for monitoring for ventricular tachycardia, but no other patients required ICU admission and none of the patients required mechanical ventilation. Preliminary reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that in the United States overall, 34% of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have required hospitalization, and among those hospitalized, 20% required admission to an ICU.
17

Our patients' symptoms were consistent with previously reported clinical presentations of COVID-19 with the majority having cough, fever, and SOB.
18
Three patients also reported diarrhea, consistent with other reports that up to 50% of patients with COVID-19 report gastrointestinal symptoms.
19

Patient 5 presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms. Others have also reported cardiac complications associated with COVID-19, including arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.
20
Underlying cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury are risk factors for severe disease and associated with increased mortality.
3
Our patient had mildly elevated troponin levels representing myocardial injury, but had a relatively mild clinical course of COVID-19. Patient 5 also had a splenic infarction, concerning for thromboembolic disease. COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability,
21
but in this patient with low cardiac ejection fraction and a subtherapeutic INR, the cause of her splenic infarction was suspected to be a left ventricular thrombus.

Of note, Patient 5 had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on admission, but tested positive 2 days later. Others have also reported cases of false negative SARS CoV-2 PCR results early in the course of disease with COVID-19.
22
,
23

In this case series, all five PLWH with COVID-19 achieved full clinical recovery. More research is needed to understand the clinical course of COVID-19 among PLWH, particularly those with poor viral suppression and/or advanced immune deficiency, as well as the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19."

The UNM Global Health COVID-19 Briefing is provided as a public service. Sources include not only peer-reviewed literature, but also preliminary research manuscripts that have not been peer reviewed along with lay news media reports. The peer-review process often results in manuscript improvement, with corrections made for errors and unsubstantiated conclusions being corrected. Furthermore, many headlines and summaries in the briefing are written by student volunteers and others who may lack subject matter expertise in this rapidly evolving field. As such, the headlines and summaries should not be regarded as conclusive. Instead, readers are encouraged to use the briefing to identify areas of interest and then use the embedded links to read and critically evaluate the primary sources.
